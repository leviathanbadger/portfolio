export default `### Minecraft Music Mod

In one of my projects at school, the requirement was to create a piece of software
that used music as a core element. For example, some people chose to create
music visualizers; others created games based on the beat in music.

For my part, I decided to use the opportunity to teach myself how to develop mods
for games. I decided to create a weapon in Minecraft that is usually ineffectual,
but is very strong when you attack to the beat. As I'm not very creative with names,
the result is called "Minecraft Music Mod."

The mod was created for an older version of minecraft, and it has since been deprecated
by changes to newer versions of the game.`;
