export default `### Capstone Project Fall 2017

I was a student at Neumont University (now called [Neumont College of Computer Science][neumont])
from September 2015 to August 2018 (expected graduation date.)
As part of the rigorous education program at Neumont, I completed a quarter-long capstone project.
This project is the Neumont undergraduate's equivalent of a graduate student's thesis defense.
The capstone project is conceived, planned, iterated upon, and executed over the course of several months.

For me, the result was a fully-asynchronous, lazy-loaded single-page-application router.
It solves some of the pain points that I have noticed in existing professional frontend
SPA routers (such as that of Angular or React.)
