export default `### OpenGL Game Engine

This engine is my second full-scale 3D game engine, created in conjunction with a friend
(Khalid Sabry). It is written in C++, and features full multithreading support,
asynchronous asset loading, and even a python interpreter overlay to allow for in-game commands.

This engine is the product of almost a year's worth of work, before it was abandoned for
my HTML5 game engine when intrinsic flaws in this game engine's structure became apparent.
I may eventually go back to this project and try to refactor the heck out of it;
or I may just start over from scratch with a brand new 3D game engine.
We'll see.`;
