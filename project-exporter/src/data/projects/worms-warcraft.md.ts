Worms Warcraft is a personal project created by merging two of my and my friends' favorite games.
Graphical assets and general gameplay style were taken from the old-style Worms games (Team17);
sound effects and story were stolen from the Warcraft series (Blizzard).
Then the standard Worms gameplay was reimagined by making the game real-time, instead of turn-based.

The result was a fast-paced, glitchy-as-hell game.

Unfortunately, shortly after I called quits on the project, Unity3D came out with an update which
broke the project. But hey, it was fun while it lasted!

#### Disclaimer

I don't own Worms or Warcraft, or have any right to use them.
This was created as a personal project, to help me learn Unity networking,
and as a tech demo for pixel-based destructible terrain.

Partly because I don't have any right to use these assets, I am not hosting a demo for this game online.
If you see me in person, you can ask me to show it off and I'll try to find it and blow off the dust.`;
