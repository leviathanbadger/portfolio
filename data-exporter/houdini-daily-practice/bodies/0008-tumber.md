### Thermos/Tumbler

I keep underestimating how hard it is to do certain things.
This one was fairly simple to model, but caused a ton of problems with normals.

I like how the sides turned out, after I figured out how to sharpen
the normals on just the vertices on the cut-out triangles.

The top skips out on a lot of detail from the original though, because
the original is curved in a lot of ways that are proving hard for me to replicate.
I think that part looks awful, but so long as you don't look too close
the model as a whole is fine.
