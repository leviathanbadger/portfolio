### Procedural Tree with Thigmotropism

Yes, "thigmotropism" is a word.

My enthusiasm for this project died half-way through, so I had to force
myself to assign materials. The ones I picked look decent from a distance,
but pretty ugly up-close.

Regarding the scene itself:

I was going for "unfortunately-placed tree makes the best of its situation
by growing around an inconveniently-placed and very unnatural-looking
rock formation". Nailed it.
