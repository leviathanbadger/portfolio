### Stormveil Castle (Day 4)

Still greyboxing. Today I:

  - Added simple HDA for outdoor ledge trim and outdoor wall wainscotting. Everything UVed.
  - Added HDA for generating spires with parameterized height, center relief, pilasters,
    wainscotting, etc. Everything UVed. Defaults to parameterized octagon for the tower
    profile, with an input to override and another input to copy the profile to points.
  - Adjust cobbleStair stair positions so the topmost stair isn't significantly above
    the ground level.
  - Improved wall above gate and added more detail. Added UVs.
  - Added walls, ground and distant stairs behind gate.
