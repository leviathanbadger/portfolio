### Mardini 2024 - Scatter & Align

Today is day 3 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Scatter & Align
SOP node][scatter-align-sop].

I've used the Scatter and Align SOP node many times, so I have a lot of practice with it.
That said, I don't feel like I'm very adept at using it still. The results I get often seem
unnatural/stilted to me. It always seems clear that the scene was "staged", so to speak, and
is not the result of some natural placement mechanism.

I was going for a lush cave mouth, like in a deep jungle, with plenty of plants on the ground
and on the cliff, hanging vines, perhaps a small stream going into the cave. That was the goal.
I missed the mark completely. I'm probably lucky if people even recognize it as a cave entrance,
let alone get all of those other details. That's partly because I don't have a lot of time to
spend on each project, so I couldn't actually create any variety of plants to scatter, let alone
attempt a stream or anything else fancy. Instead I scattered a variety of rocks on the ground
and called it a day.

It's my worst one so far, but I have to do one of these every day and I have maybe 2 hours
to do each. So this is where I stop.
