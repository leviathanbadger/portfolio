### Creepy Rig (Day 5)

I went back to add more detail the base model, including a more
sculpted body (especially head), ears, nose, and eyelids. I then updated
the skin capture weights again and updated the control rig.

For some reason, after doing all of this, _one_ of the eyes is now displayed
with a blue tint. I have no idea why, I did nothing to specify a color here.

Even though I would like to go back and add more detail to the arms and hands,
I don't think I will because each time I change the base model I have to
redo the capture weights; and with more and more joints on the skeleton that
is becoming prohibitive.

For much of this, I'm following along with this [tutorial][fur_dude_tutorial].
