### Mardini 2025 - Control Panel

Today is day 10 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "METAL",
in the SOPS category.

Today I worked on creating a futuristic desk/control panel for a spaceship or other
sci-fi setting (in the abstract.) I began by looking for images to use as inspiration,
and I found one that I actually liked a lot, so I pulled it to use as a reference.
I didn't recreate it 100%, but the general idea is definitely the same.

The downside to this is that I didn't focus on Copernicus/COPS as much as I wanted to
(considering it's the theme of this week in Mardini.) I'm still counting it because I
used COPS for one of the textures, but there was a lot more I could have done if I
hadn't spent so much time on modeling. Decals, scratches/grunge maps, etc.

New stuff:

  - I used the Chain SOP for the first time since... well, [practice day 5][day-5].
    Three and a half years ago. My usage here wasn't quite as involved with
    specifically this node as that day was, but it had its own challenges to work
    through because I was using the SOP differently. I used it for the boolean
    subtract geometry for the backplate. (Not sure what to call it.)
  - In COPS, I generated a hex tile pattern, which was more difficult than I
    anticipated. The Tile Pattern COP doesn't have hex tiles built-in, so I had
    to adapt it by generating my own pattern definition and using a stamp to place
    the hexagons on each tile. Even then, I had trouble getting the tile proportions
    right and configuring it correctly to tile the texture seamlessly in both
    directions.
