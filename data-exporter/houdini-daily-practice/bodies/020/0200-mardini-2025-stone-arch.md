### Mardini 2025 - Stone Arch

Today is day 8 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "STONE",
in the SOPS category.

This project took nearly three days to complete, since I burned out pretty hard. I burned
up all of the lead I had, and I'm desperately hoping I can make it back on the weekend
because I don't think next week will be any better. Full time work + using pretty much
all of my free time for this is not a fun way to spend my time. I'm very tempted to give
up on Mardini for this year, even though I know I'll regret it later.

Evem so, taking a break was the right move. While the end result isn't one of the best
practices I've ever had (in fact, I think it's one of the worst of this month, with so
many clashing colors) it's much better than it would have been if I just pushed to
complete it on the day I started.

New stuff:

  - I used some pretty fancy SOPS wrangling to dynamically extrude segments on the arch.
    I've made an arch pretty similar to this before, but I manually extruded individual
    segments then because I couldn't figure out how to achieve this look procedurally.
    The end result is the same, generally speaking, but I really appreciate the concrete
    proof that I'm getting better at the technical aspects of Houdini.
  - The big thing was that this is the most I've ever used Copernicus for image composition.
    Specifically I learned a lot about the Tile Pattern COP and UV Transform COP to generate
    the wall and floor textures, and the Fractal Noise COP for color and displacement
    variety. Fractal noise was good enough for an initial attempt at this, but it doesn't
    actually look great up close so in the future I'll have to figure out how to generate
    more complex patterns.
