### Heart of the Stone of Tear (Day 1)

The first day of modeling and rendering the Heart of the Stone of Tear; a
significant room in a giant fortress in the Wheel of Time. I haven't started
modeling the sword that is not a sword yet, and instead I positioned a demo
asset humanoid in the center for scale.

You'll have to forgive Rand for being naked. Although he's not anatomically
correct, I still had fun fuzzing out the inappropriate bits.
