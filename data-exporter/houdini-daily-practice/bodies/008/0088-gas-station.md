### Gas Station (Day 1)

I've recently been watching the Netflix adaptation for The Sandman
(originally written by Niel Gaiman.) I was inspired by two particular scenes -
one oblique angle at a window outside of a gas station, which occurs in
episode 4, and another in a normal diner that slowly devolves to insanity.
What I'm working on will not match either scene perfectly, but instead takes
elements from both.

The main focus today was to 1. create the general building, including four
walls, a floor, a ceiling, and a window; and 2. to create a neon "open" sign
that will reflect in the window.

The neon sign is using a highly emissive material, but as Karma doesn't do any
postprocessing effects, you can't easily see any kind of glow. Tomorrow I may
experiment with adding tiny dust particles in the air to catch the light from
the the neon sign. Or I may focus on filling out the store's interior. Or both,
depending on how much time I end up having for practice.
