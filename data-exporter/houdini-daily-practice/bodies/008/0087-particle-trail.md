### Particle Trail

Today I didn't have a plan going in. I just played around with a custom solver,
the TimeShift SOP, and creating a particle trail. The end results look... fine.

You can't exactly tell what's going on here. I just did random math stuff to try
to create variation in particle behavior. It partially worked, but it still looks
more contiguous than I was aiming for.

Additionally, I've never attempted to render curves directly rather than first
converting it into geometry. It's good practice for VFX, even if it isn't great
for creating game assets.
