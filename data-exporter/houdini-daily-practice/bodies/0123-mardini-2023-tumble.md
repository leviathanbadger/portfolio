### Mardini 2023 - Tumble

Today is day 18 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "tumble".

Originally I was going to just make a tumbleweed in a desert setting, before I
realized... that's incredibly boring. So I didn't do that.

Instead I recreated something that I made a long time ago; a rope bridge. This time
it took about 2 hours to model it, and another hour to render. Previously, I made
the bridge over the course of about four days, with several hours each day. That's
not to say the end result is the same. The biggest difference is that the original
rope bridge was parameterized and moved into a digital asset so it could be reused.
It just wouldn't make sense to work on that for a daily art project, so I didn't
spend the time. Aside from that, I also kept the ropes and knots as tubes and spheres,
trusting the shader to apply displacement to add detail, rather than modeling the
strands myself.

Unoriginal, I know. I've done it before. But I'm happy I could redo it so quickly.

Other than that, I did try something relatively new with the cliff - a shader that
blends together two different materials based on the direction the pixel is facing.
I've done something similar with the bark shader in my most recent tree render,
but 1. it was a single material still, just different UVs being blended; and 2. the
Labs tree generator created the blend "mask" automatically, and I did it myself here.
