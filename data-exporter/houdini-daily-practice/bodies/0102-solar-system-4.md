### Solar System (Day 4)

I'm planning to create a really high-resolution render of two of my projects, then order
a custom two-sided puzzle printed so I can assemble it in a physical form. Just on a whim.
I haven't decided what I'll do for the second side, but the first side will be a variation
on the solar system project I started back in May of last year.

I'm changing it from being an abstract solar-system render to being a desk/office view
with a cluttered desk, including scale models of the planets in the solar system only as
decorations.

Today I modeled and created the material for the keyboard model. To do this, I created a
JSON file with the width and height of each key, then wrote a python script to translate
that data into points with attached attributes in Houdini.

Additionally, I revisited the pen holder from Houdini practice day 2, added a material,
and imported it into this project.
