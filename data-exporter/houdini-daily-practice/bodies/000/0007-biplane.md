### Biplane

It's not done, but this is the first daily that's taken >3 hours since the first.

I was not ready to tackle this one yet. Learned a lot working my way through it, but still...

  - The wheels are stubbed out so I don't spend more time on daily practice.
  - Also front propeller is missing entirely

Other things have to get done too

It's based on a lot of random online images, but probably most on the biplane in this video.
