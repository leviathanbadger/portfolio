### Table

This is my kitchen table, which I'm selling before an upcoming move.
I wanted to model it before the chance was gone because it's actually a really nice table.

I added a lot of detail that probably would be better baked into the texture.
However, I think this is good still because 1. LOD is a thing, and 2. Houdini
allows you to bake a normal map for a lower-quality model from a
higher-quality version (haven't learned how to do it yet though).

I really need to learn to UV map in Houdini, so I'm not stuck with mostly solid colors.
