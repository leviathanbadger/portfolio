### Gas Station (Day 2)

Continuing the gas station project I started during the last practice session.
It's been almost two weeks, I've been busy with other ventures.

The main focus today was to 1. add a door so there's an obvious way to enter
the building, and 2. add a few of the larger-scale pieces of furniture in broad,
greybox-style strokes.

I don't love the materials, but I didn't put too much time into creating them
because I know that the models for each of the pieces of furniture are mostly
temporary. Putting extra effort into the materials now would be a waste.
