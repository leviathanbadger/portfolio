### Mardini 2025 - Rocky Cave

Today is day 5 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "ENVIRONMENT",
in the SOPS category.

For today I attempted, again, to make a rocky cave. It went horribly wrong, and I regret
choosing this project, but I'm now out of time allocated to work on it so it's not going
to get any better. This is the worst so far, except maybe for the very first day (the
spinning top)

I went overboard on the chromatic abberration to spice it up a bit. Then I disabled all
of the lights except for the procedurally generated glowing striations, which helped
obscure the lack of detail by making the scene much darker and giving something to
draw the eye.

New stuff:

  - I guess the way I generated the cave is kind of new. I was experimenting, trying to
    get a lot of procedural detail without doing much art directing outside of setting up
    the initial cave layout. Unfortunately, the result I ended up with was... not ideal.
    The eventual render had about 15 million polygons, and yet doesn't appear to be all
    that detailed. Honestly I might have to come back to this concept and just follow a
    tutorial written by someone else at some point. I'm not sure what I did wrong or how
    to improve it.
  - I tried to make a material with striated rock to light up the cave interior. Mixed
    results. Mostly improves the render, but it wasn't what I was going for originally.
