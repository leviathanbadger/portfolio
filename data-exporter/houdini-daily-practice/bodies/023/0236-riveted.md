### Riveted

This is the sixth prompt of the [Nodevember 2025](https://www.nodevember-2025.com/),
"Riveted".

I'll return to the 2024 prompts later, but since I skipped nodevember this year in
favor of writing 30k words in November, I'm going to go to the 2025 prompts and do
the 2024 prompts later.

I've been having difficulty returning to practice lately, and I eventually realized
that in part it's because I'm getting paralyzed by how much work it is to do a single
daily practice. So I'm going to limit myself to 2 hours per practice to make it easier to
get started and finish each day. I don't necessarily expect this to work very well,
because I'm a perfectionist, but it's worth a try.

I had a few ideas for today, but the main one I thought I could realistically do in the
time frame was just an old-fashioned boiler, which I wasn't particularly excited about.
However, then I realized that since I'm not submitting this anywhere, I don't actually
*have* to have a finished art product at the end of the day. And that cleared it up for
me. I immediately went to the hardest idea I had, fully intending to get maybe 10%
through just the modeling process, without any effort at all spent on rigging,
animating, texturing, or creating a renderable composition (materials, cameras,
lighting, etc.).

And that's what I did. I had a lot of fun, got about 2% through the project overall, and
put it down for the day. *After exactly 2 hours.* Huzzah!

It's a 'big daddy' model, from Bioshock. I'm referencing mostly the big daddy from
Bioshock 1, but the models change from game to game, and canonically they can vary
significantly from individual to individual (Bioshock 2 in particular has this as a
significant plot point.) So I'm not too concerned with getting everything right, I
just want to invoke the feel.

I will probably come back to this later, because I was having a lot of fun with it.
However, I'm concerned that my motivation for the project will tank as soon as I'm
done with the mostly rigid parts (drill arm, face plate) and have to try to model
the more organic parts of the arms/legs/torso. And either way I'm trying to get through
the month with last year's Nodevember prompts, so the project is on the backburner for
a few months at least.
