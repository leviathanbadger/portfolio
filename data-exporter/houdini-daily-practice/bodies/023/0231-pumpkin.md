### Pumpkin

This is the first prompt of the [Nodevember 2025][nodevember-2025], "Pumpkin".

I'll return to the 2024 prompts later, but since I skipped nodevember this year in
favor of writing 30k words in November, I'm going to go to the 2025 prompts and do
the 2024 prompts later.

I've been having difficulty returning to practice lately, and I eventually realized
that in part it's because I'm getting paralyzed by how much work it is to do a single
daily practice. So I'm going to limit myself to 2 hours per practice to make it easier to
get started and finish each day. I don't necessarily expect this to work very well,
because I'm a perfectionist, but it's worth a try.

This time, the two-hour limit resulted in a very simple pumpkin field. The original goal
was to make a single pumpkin carved as a jack-o-lantern, but I very quickly realized that
was out of scope for two hours, so I switched to making a field of simple pumpkins.
The technical practice was two-fold:

  1. Making an HDA that generates a pumpkin mesh with adjustable parameters. Just one
     could be art-directed more, but an HDA has to be more flexible.
  2. Creating realistic-looking (or realistic enough) organic curves for the pumpkin ribs.

I ran out of time so:

  - The result contains no textures, just the simplest possible materials
  - The mesh HDA creates a visible (and ugly) circle at the top of each pumpkin. I'd like
    to get rid of it, but 2 hours wasn't enough.

For future practices I'll try to give myself more time to texture better, or at least
to make the simple materials look intentional by using some kind of postprocessing effect.
