### Feather

This is the fifth prompt of the [Nodevember 2025](https://www.nodevember-2025.com/),
"Feather".

I'll return to the 2024 prompts later, but since I skipped nodevember this year in
favor of writing 30k words in November, I'm going to go to the 2025 prompts and do
the 2024 prompts later.

I've been having difficulty returning to practice lately, and I eventually realized
that in part it's because I'm getting paralyzed by how much work it is to do a single
daily practice. So I'm going to limit myself to 2 hours per practice to make it easier to
get started and finish each day. I don't necessarily expect this to work very well,
because I'm a perfectionist, but it's worth a try.

It's Rita Skeeter's "quick quotes quill!" Does it look like it? No? Well, that's all
right. You don't look like it either.

This took 2.5 hours, and it's by far my least favorite so far this month. It's
predictable really; I don't have a lot of experience with the grooming tools to begin
with; and I have almost no experience with the feather tools. Add that to the fact that
I'm going for a *very* nonstandard groom (not a creature in any sense), and I've never
tried to render feathers with a texture, and I'm on a strict time limit...

Yeah. It sucks. I know. But hey, it makes a passable tree branch, maybe. Not what I was
going for, but I'll take it. I'll admit, I actually wanted to animate it scribbling
something into a notebook. And not just simple transformation, but a full-on vellum
simulation to let the spine and feathers wag. My hubris knows no bounds.
