### Bouquet

This is the fourth prompt of the [Nodevember 2025](https://www.nodevember-2025.com/),
"Bouquet".

I'll return to the 2024 prompts later, but since I skipped nodevember this year in
favor of writing 30k words in November, I'm going to go to the 2025 prompts and do
the 2024 prompts later.

I've been having difficulty returning to practice lately, and I eventually realized
that in part it's because I'm getting paralyzed by how much work it is to do a single
daily practice. So I'm going to limit myself to 2 hours per practice to make it easier to
get started and finish each day. I don't necessarily expect this to work very well,
because I'm a perfectionist, but it's worth a try.

It's the magical rose from Beauty and the Beast. Some of the petals have already fallen.
I don't have a closeup of the rose because there's actually quite a few intersection issues
that I didn't have a lot of time to try to fix. I could perhaps have fixed them given more
time, but for this project I judged that careful deintersection would be irrelevant. The
rose is seen from a medium distance, and it's poorly lit, and it's all pretty much one
color. If you look carefully you can probably see some of the intersection problems, but
there's plausible deniability, especially at a glance.

The parts I *didn't* make, because I ran out of time:

  * I used a free HDRI for lighting from [PolyHaven](https://polyhaven.com/a/fireplace)
because I know from experience that glass doesn't usually render well without something
to reflect/refract.
  * I used one of the built-in wood materials for the rose case base because a simple brown
color made the whole scene look dull and relatively unfinished. Small details matter.

Everything else I made myself, (mostly) within the two-hour self-imposed time limit. (It
took 2.5 hours.) I'm getting better! Sort of.
