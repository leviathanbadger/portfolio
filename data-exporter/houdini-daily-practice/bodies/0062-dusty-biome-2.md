### Dusty Biome

Today I scattered rocks on the terrain created previously. Additionally I changed
the render to use distortion instead of outputting the mesh directly; and I improved
the lighting of the scene.

I also made a few smaller changes that weren't part of the tutorial series. In order
to demonstrate scale, I added test geometry in the middle of the scene; then I found
a way to simulate footprints in the sand leading back from the figure and into the
distance. It won't hold up to close scrutiny, but I'm pleased with how it turned out
for the camera position chosen for this render.

I don't love how the rocks turned out, but I'm ready to move onto another biome type.
