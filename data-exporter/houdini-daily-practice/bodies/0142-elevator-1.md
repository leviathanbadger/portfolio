### 'The Shining' Elevator (Day 1)

I didn't get as far with this as I was hoping to today, but I did make some steady progress.
The purpose is to recreate an iconic scene from the films "The Shining" and "Doctor Sleep"
using:

  - fSpy to infer camera position, rotation, and other settings from the reference image
  - Houdini to block out and eventually model the scene
  - Adobe Painter to texture everything
  - Houdini FLIP to simulate the blood flooding out of the elevator
  - Houdini TOPS/PDG and COPS to "paint" the blood splatter overlays on the walls/furniture
  - MaterialX, Solaris, and Karma XPU to render everything
  - After Effects to comp everything together, and apply post-processing effects like film
    grain, color correction, slight blur, etc.

Today I'm just starting to block everything out. I went overboard modeling the wainscotting.
(Not sure if I'm using that term correctly, but I don't know what else to call it.)

I used the software "fSpy" to get a good starting point for my camera position and other
settings, to make it easier to model precisely. However, I had to adjust the camera settings
manually regardless. Perhaps the reference scene has some incorrect angles; more likely, I
just don't know how to use the software well yet.
