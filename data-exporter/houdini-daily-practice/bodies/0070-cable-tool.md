### Cable Tool (Day 1)

Following along with a tutorial to learn how to create a procedural cable
tool that uses the Vellum solver and integrates with Unreal Engine to allow
for a significant amount of detail in a game engine environment.

This is just the first part; I'm only on the second video. I haven't done
anything with HDAs yet, or with Unreal Engine, but there's a very simple
Vellum solver with a bit of randomness in cable stretchiness.
