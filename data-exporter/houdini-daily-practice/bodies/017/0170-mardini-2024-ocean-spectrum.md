### Mardini 2024 - Ocean Spectrum

Today is day 16 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Ocean
Spectrum SOP node][ocean-spectrum-sop].

I used the ocean shelf tools in a [previous entry][kma-phys-sky-entry] in order to get
some practice, because I knew today's prompt was coming up.

The original idea was to recreate a short scene from ["The Titanic" (1997)][titanic-scene]
where The Titanic is leaving port for the first time and it passes behind a tiny sail boat,
completely filling the frame where the sail boat barely took up a tiny fraction.

Of course, that idea went almost entirely out the window due to time constraints. I
wasted _so much time_ just creating a tiny, not-life-accurate sailboat, complete with
rotating mast with sail animated by a vellum cloth simulation. Which I then animated
bobbing up and down on the ocean by using all the maths to get the correct position
and orientation for the boat's coordinates on the ocean spectrum.

What I _didn't_ get to:

  - All of the clouds.
  - The bird flying in the background.
  - The people on the sail boat, for scale
  - The frickin' Titanic. Including a FLIP simulation of the ocean water being displaced,
    which I can get away with not including for the sail boat because it's not even moving.
  - Actually realistic-looking sail boat. What I modeled is a vague archetypal boat, like
    a child's idea of a boat when they have never seen one before except in reality-warped
    cartoons.
  - Post-processing effects to make it look like it was filmed, not rendered.

Next week will be rough, because I'm already completing these practices the day before they're
due. I now have a firm move-in date, and next week has four days relating to character rigging
and animation, which I'm _really_ bad at. Plus animations take longer to complete and to render.
So... I might not complete every day, which will suck, but working and getting ready for my
move take priority.
