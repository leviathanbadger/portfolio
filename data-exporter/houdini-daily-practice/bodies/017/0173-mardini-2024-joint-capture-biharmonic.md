### Mardini 2024 - Joint Capture Biharmonic

Today is day 19 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Joint
Capture Biharmonic SOP node][joint-capture-biharmonic-sop].

Rigging takes a lot of time for me, because I'm not very good at it. So I purposely
designed a model that is very easy to rig, and that I can animate using simple
trigonometric functions. Even so, I ran out of time and had to settle on quickly-chosen
solid color materials when setting up the scene in the LOPs context.

I didn't altogether hate this practice, mostly because cactus people aren't real so
the motion doesn't need to follow rules I don't understand to move "accurately".
It still has a cartoon aesthetic, partially because of the animation and partially
because of the overly simple render materials, but that's perfectly acceptable for
me.
