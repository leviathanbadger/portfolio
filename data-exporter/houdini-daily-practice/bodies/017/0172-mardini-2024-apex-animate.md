### Mardini 2024 - APEX Animate

Today is day 18 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [APEX
Animate SOP node][apex-animate-sop].

I really dislike character animation. I like it _in theory_, but in practice everything
I try just looks bad and I don't know how to fix it.

Most of today needs to be spent on move prep, so I can't afford to work out all of the
many issues with this animation. I tried to go with the simplest possible scene but
since I've never used the APEX toolset before, it ended up taking 2 hours anyway.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
