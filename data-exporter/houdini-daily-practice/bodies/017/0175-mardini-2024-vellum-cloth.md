### Mardini 2024 - Vellum Cloth

Today is day 21 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Vellum
Cloth][vellum-cloth] shelf tool.

I went for a hero silhouette with a cape. The idea was to have a simple cloth simulation
with a strong wind, but only render a still frame at a particularly photogenic frame.
The animation would have been much harder to art-direct, but so long as I only need a
single frame to look nice, the rest isn't a problem.

I purchased the [shark man model][shark-man] from Fred Drabble on sketchfab. It isn't
rigged, or posed so that I can rig it myself, but for this project I don't need that,
and it's already posed well for a decent silhouette.

I'm not 100% satisfied with the way it turned out. It's hard to see that it's a shark
man from just the silhouette, so I added a small bit of emissive lighting from the
cape in order to cheat and give the head a bit of contour.
