### Mardini 2024 - Hair Generate

Today is day 22 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Hair
Generate SOP node][hair-generate-sop].

I tried. The hair tools are fairly easy to work with, but it's very difficult for me
to picture what the end result will be. Finally, by the end I ended up with a result
where some of the hair was too dense, but large sections (the face, for example)
were not dense enough and showed large chunks of skin.

I'm out of time though, because I still have to render an animation. So this is as
good as it'll get.

I purchased the [dog model][dog-model] previously, by RedDeer, on sketchfab.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
