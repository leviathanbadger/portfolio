### Mardini 2024 - Material Linker

Today is day 6 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Material Linker
LOP node][material-linker-lop].

Although I've rarely used this node before, it's basically just another way of doing what
I've already done on dozens of projects. So, today's project is kind of a freebie, in the
sense that I can pick very nearly any scene to create and I'll be able to use the node with
minimal difficulty. I'm technically following the prompt no matter art what I pick to create.

Today I opted to try my hand at creating and rendering terrain again. I've done this on
several projects in the past, but it's still a difficult thing for me to do because a lot
of it is trial and error. I used some concept art for Halo Infinite as inspiration for the
broken circular rings in middle center. The mountains were created using the Heightfield
Project SOP node, which I've seen before but never really had an occasion to use. I used
the Karma Physical Sky node in lieu of an HDRI map. The terrain material was driven by
primvars created by the heightfield generator's erode nodes, such as "water", "debris",
"bedrock", "sediment", etc.

I had a lot of fun, and I like how it was turning out, but I still ran out of time and had
to stop without adding any kind of scatter detail, or clouds, or birds or other animals,
or anything else that might have added depth to the scene. I will almost definitely return to
this project after Mardini 2024 is over.
