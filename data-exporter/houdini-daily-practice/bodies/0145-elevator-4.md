### 'The Shining' Elevator (Day 4)

Today I started by adding chains above the chandeliers. This helps more than I expected it to.
The chandeliers no longer appear like they're just floating there (because they aren't.) It's
interesting how something like this - that you don't normally even notice - can make something
look just wrong enough to be obviously fake. Other than that, I also fiddled with the chandelier
model itself to make it slightly smaller.

I modeled the vase between the two elevator doors as well. No fancy texture, just a slightly
shiny grey material.

I also modeled the two Oil heaters on either side of the elevator doors at the end of the hallway.
Both are identical. The material uses textures created in Substance Painter. This is probably
overkill, considering how far in the distance the heaters are, so you can't really see any of
the details anyway. But it was good practice.

Finally I fiddled with the camera settings - adding depth of field - and lighting - changing the
color and intensity to better match reference image.
