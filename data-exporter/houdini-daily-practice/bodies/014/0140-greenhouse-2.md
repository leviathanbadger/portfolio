### Greenhouse (Day 2)

Incremental updates today. I fiddled with the dimensions of the greenhouse, adjusted UVs and
materials, and - probably the only really visible change at a glance - added procedurally-generated
support pillars and arches. I'm mostly happy with how they turned out, although I don't love the
"tiger spot" non-pattern of the arches. Still, it's not terrible, I just wish it was less
random-looking.

I was going to add some plants today as well, but I changed my mind because the pillars and arches
took more time than I expected.
