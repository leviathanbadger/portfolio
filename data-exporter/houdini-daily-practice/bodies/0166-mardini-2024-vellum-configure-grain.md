### Mardini 2024 - Vellum Configure Grain

Today is day 12 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Vellum
Configure Grain SOP node][vellum-configure-grain-sop].

This is another project that I started with no real idea where I was going with it. I'm
sure there are plenty of great use cases for a sand simulation in VFX and digital art, but
I'm not creative enough to find them.

So... I ended up just creating a weird obstactle course for two colors of sand, then
watching the simulation complete. I did do something interesting in post though - like my
[hourglass render][hourglass-render] from last year's Mardini, I picked colors for the
sand grains from the end position of the particle. However, this time I attempted to
gradually fade from the start color to the end to give the impression that an organized
system went through a chaotic process, before ultimately creating an organized result.
It's too early for me to see if it seems to have worked - I'm typing this up as it's
rendering, and it's very difficult to get a feel for the cohesion of an animation
without looking at it in realtime - but I'm hopeful. Either way, I'm out of time.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
