### Mardini 2023 - Grow

Today is day 14 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "grow".

First thought was to make an animation of a bouncy castle getting inflated. But Houdini
kept crashing as I tried to work on that, so I moved on to plan B: a space elevator.
Don't ask how this is related to the "grow" prompt, it made sense when I started
working on it and only realized afterwards that it's a bit of a stretch.

The technical challenge here was that I wanted to use COPS to procedurally generate
a planet, with water bodies and land masses and massive glaciers and clouds. Which
I did. It just... doesn't look good. COPs is a powerful tool, but it's very constrained
and difficult to use programmatically.

The whole project turned into a flop in my opinion. This is my least favorite entry in
the Mardini competition, including the paper boat animation that doesn't look like a
paper boat and isn't in fact an animation.
