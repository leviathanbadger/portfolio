### Filament Swatches

Along with my new 3D printer, I also purchased a ton of varieties of filament. It was
hard to know exactly what each filament would look like, especially in multi-filament
prints, so I decided to print some filament swatches so I could use them to pick
materials for later 3D prints. There are plenty of swatch models you can get through
various online tools, but allof them were... kinda awful to use. Frankly. So I made
my own.
