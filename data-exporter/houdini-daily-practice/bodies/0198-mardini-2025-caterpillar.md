### Mardini 2025 - Caterpillar

Today is day 6 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "CHARACTER",
in the SOPS category.

For this prompt, I attempted to create a caterpillar with simple geometric shapes.
It wasn't really working, the result kept looking too mechanical and placeholdery.
(Yes, that's a word. I just made it up.) So, I leaned into the first part. This
had the added benefit that it simplified the rendering a lot, since all of the
materials could be either a bright paint color or a dark metallic material. Both
of these are very easy to create and don't require much fine tuning.

I like the end result, but I did take too long on this project just to make the
caterpillar itself, so I didn't have time to add scenery, or scuff marks, or
a variety of other things I was hoping to get to. The current plan is to revisit
this model on a later day in this Mardini to animate it; I'm hoping to get to all
of that at that point.

New stuff:

  - It's not a new node or rendering technique. The "new learning" I did was to
    procedurally generate the positions of the caterpillar segments and orientations.
    While it doesn't seem like a lot, the system I put in place for this is more
    dynamic than it appears in this stillframe and it should be a good starting
    point for animating it later. It also required using quaternions much more than
    I've used in the past, which is good practice for when I go back to attempt
    the growing tree project I abandoned for day 4.
