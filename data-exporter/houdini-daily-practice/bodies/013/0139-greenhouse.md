### Greenhouse (Day 1)

This project didn't have much planning going into it, I just wanted to do something
since it's been almost a month (again) since my last practice. I didn't have much time
today, but I did manage to get a very small greenhouse scene render. There's lots of
work until it actually looks good, but this is fine for day one.

Ideas to improve (not all will be implemented):

  - Add shelves with potted plants procedurally placed to break up stone wall. It's
    too easy to see the repeating pattern here.
  - Add metal pillars in center of room going up to support the roof
  - Add rows of planters with potting soil and more "wild" plants
  - Add grunge/dirt so things don't look so pristine
  - Add trowel/gloves/other gardening implements
  - Add netting/scaffolding with hanging vines
  - Reduce size of greenhouse, then increase plant density
  - Add outdoor chairs/bench
  - Render as HDRI, then tonemap
  - Slight camera focus so closer objects are in focus and the end of the greenouse
    is blurred
  - Better align procedural window pane material with actual strut geometry.
