### Mardini 2024 - FLIP Solver

Today is day 17 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [FLIP
Solver SOP node][flip-solver-sop].

I cheated a bit for this one. I'm short on time for reasons I've already elaborated on,
so instead of running a full FLIP simulation, which I know would take several hours at
a minimum, and then rendering a complete animation - I just took a practice result
that I threw away previously because the simulation went so far off the rails, cleaned
it up a bit, and rendered a still frame from just before everything went wrong.
