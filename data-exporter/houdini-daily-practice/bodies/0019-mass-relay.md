### Mass Relay

...from Mass Effect.

I'll be first to admit I missed the mark, almost completely. If I gave it another few days
I could probably get the shape closer, but the curves are kind of weird to model.

I want to animate to "jump to FTL" sequence. I have the rings spinning correctly already
(although you can't tell from the still image) but I'm having a really hard time 1. modeling
the relay itself, and 2. figuring out the material for the mass effect field (big glowing
thing between the rings.)
