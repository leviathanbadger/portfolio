### Halloween Chandelier (Day 1)

I'm trying to learn a bit more about lighting in general. I created a simple scene - a chandelier, with five
bulbs hidden by shades. The point is for me to learn to light the room even when the light source is occluded
by geometry (the shades). I've done similar projects before, but in those cases I generally got "close enough"
to what I was originally shooting for then gave up.

I don't have a good result as of yet. It's still way too dark, yet the shades are incredibly bright for some
reason. This image was rendered in 4k, with 1024 samples per pixel, then denoised and scaled down to 1080p.
It took several minutes to render using Karma XPU; and even so, the results display some noticeable denoising
artifacts, and the scene is too dark. I'm going to do some research and continue this project tomorrow;
hopefully I can improve the output then.

In future practices, other than fixing the lights, I also intend to attempt a procedural cobweb in the
chandelier, and add some swirly fog to get a volumetric effect from the lights. We'll see how it goes.
