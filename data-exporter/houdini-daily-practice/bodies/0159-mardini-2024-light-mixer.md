### Mardini 2024 - Light Mixer

Today is day 5 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Light Mixer
LOP node][light-mixer-lop].

First off... I threw together another bowl of marbles, despite doing several projects like
that before, because I knew I didn't have a lot of time and I wanted to focus it on learning
more about LookDev and this node than on creating the scene in the SOPs context.

I'm not a very creative person, typically. I like Houdini (in large part) because it allows
me to create things procedurally. It takes a lot of the creativity out of making art, because
it makes everything reentrant and repeatable. If I try something and don't like the result,
I can modify some parameters and - nearly instantly - get a completely _different_ result.

I build things like this because I'm not good at doing it the other way - sculpting clay,
or picking colors of paint, fine motor control for detailing work, etc. All of that just
isn't easy for me. It's not exactly that I don't like doing it, it's more that I know I'm
_really_ not good at it, and I likely never will be, so I'd rather stick to what I know
well, even if the specific application is new. I'm a programmer. I like procedures. I like
having hard and fast rules to follow. I like determinism. I like objective qualities, such
as measurements and aspect ratios, rather than subjective qualities, such as mood or meaning.

LookDev is the antithesis of that focus. I don't know how to light a scene properly, to
emphasize an object or change the tone. It's not a science, it's an art. It's like cooking.
"Season to taste."

All of that is to say... I tried. Ah well.
