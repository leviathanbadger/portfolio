### Mardini 2023 - Smooth

Today is day 5 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "smooth".

I struggled to come up with a response to this prompt. The only idea I had was to model
a stick of butter. Y'know, because butter... is smooth. It was a pretty awful idea, to
be honest, and took all of 30 seconds to complete, considering it's just a distorted
cube with beveled edges.

Anyway... after adding a great deal more complexity, I'm happy-ish with the way it
turned out. I got to practice with Vellum a lot more. I simulated the tablecloth using
a cloth sim. I also simulated "baking" the loaf of bread and the slices falling over
using Vellum softbodies. I think it would look a good deal better if I used actual
textures and materials for everything, but one of the rules of the contest is the
art has to be made in Houdini. For future projects I may see if it's possible to
apply an SBSAR file within a COPnet, in which case I'll probably justify it, but for
now this result is... fine.

I also got to play with the "point deform" SOP for the first time. It's surprisingly
easy to use, I'll have to use it again in the future.
