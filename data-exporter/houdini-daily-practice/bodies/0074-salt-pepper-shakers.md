### Salt & Pepper Shakers

I recently ran out of salt, and it turns out the shaker I had wasn't
refillable. Because of that, I bought a new salt & pepper shaker set. When
it arrived, I used it as an opportunity to get back into 3D modeling and
rendering after yet _another_ unintentional hiatus.

The version on this site took took almost 4 minutes to render even with my
beefy new computer. Refraction, reflection, and caustics are expensive. I
also rendered the same thing in 4K, and it took just over 15 minutes.

I couldn't quite get the steel material to display anisotropic specular
reflections as you can see in the reference image. I'm not sure if I just
misunderstand how you are supposed to configure that or if there's an
issue with the MaterialX materials or Karma CPU renderer.
