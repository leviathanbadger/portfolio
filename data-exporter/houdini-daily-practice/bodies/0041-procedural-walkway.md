### Procedural Walkway (Day 1)

I'm going to spend a few days trying to recreate some of the assets used
in the recently-released game "The Ascent", a cyberpunk game made by
Neon Giant.

Neon Giant is a relatively small team, but despite that they have an
incredible amount of detail in their assets because they create so much
of their world procedurally using custom Houdini digital assets.

While I am not trying to plaigarize anything here, I would like to learn
how a lot of what they did was made. So, here we go... day one of many.
