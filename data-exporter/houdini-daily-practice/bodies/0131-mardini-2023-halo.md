### Mardini 2023 - Halo

Today is day 26 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "halo".

It's a solar eclipse. Except that as soon as the sun is completely hidden behind the
moon, it blows up.

I struggled to make this, not because the geometry is complicated (it's not) but
because to get the halo effect there needs to be a significant amount of volumetric
lighting, which is both hard to do and cripplingly hard to do efficiently.

The theme of the last week is "really expensive lighting". It's good, because it
allows me to learn more than I would if I was just sailing along making geometry
without regard for making it look pretty or using fancy lights. But also, I feel like
I'm behind the curve on this much more than I am on creating geometry, because
creating geometry is mostly intuitive, at least in comparison to lighting.

All of that said... I deliberately picked a project that wouldn't take a ton of
time to complete. And then I fiddled with it until I got an image that looked
halfway decent, and pretended that's what I was going for the whole time. I basically
cheated.
