### Mardini 2024 - Pyro Burst Source

Today is day 15 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Pyro
Burst Source SOP node][pyro-burst-source-sop].

This practice is attempting to create an effect similar to the reverse-explosion
explosion in the movie, [Tenet][tenet]. Of course, that's a lot to ask when I'm not
super familiar with RBD simulations, and I've only ever done one Pyro simulation before.
This practice forced me to do two of each, with some convoluated time manipulation nodes
to "composite" them together, with the first pair in reverse.

I had to do the RBD simulation first so that I could use the collapsing building
as a collider in the pyro explosion simulations.

I should not have spent so much time on this, especially not while I'm working full-time
and preparing to move. At the very least, I shouldn't have been as picky about the
results and not worried so much about the edge damage on the concrete building.

This project is a candidate for a project that I return to after Mardini is over.
