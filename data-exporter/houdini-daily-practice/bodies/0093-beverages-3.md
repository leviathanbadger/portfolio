### Beverages (Day 3)

The juice bottle HDA is now parameterized so I can create several copies
with adjusted parameters. Here you see "fruit punch" and "strawberry"
flavored juices using the same HDA as the original mango flavored drink.

The label itself was a bit tricky; I separated out the base image so I
can use the red component to mix the base color and a highlight color,
then I combined it with a decal for the labels, barcode, nutrition
information, and other text.

I also found a way to remove the black refraction artifacting; however,
in the process I created another artifact, which might just be worse.
Now the bottles look thicker, as if they're glass instead of plastic. The
outline isn't _too_ noticable from a distance, so I won't worry about it
much. I'll just cry myself to sleep for a few days and then forget about
it.

Tomorrow I'll be adding two new types of bottle: a generic 1 liter soda
bottle, and a chocolate milk quart bottle. After that I'll try a few
sizes of soda can.
