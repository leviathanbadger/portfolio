### Beverages (Day 1)

Today I went to a gas station and bought 15-20 different bottles of various
liquids. The intent was to get a variety of reference assets that I could
use to generate contents for my gas station project's beverage fridges.

Turns out, however, that it's incredibly difficult to model these bottles
with the degree of fidelity that I've been going for. So today I only have
the one bottle modeled that I started with - the "root beer" bottle.

The reference asset is A&W, but I'm stripping brands in part because I
don't want to get in trouble, and mostly because that way I can fudge the
2D asset creation a bit (the drink brand label, for example.)
