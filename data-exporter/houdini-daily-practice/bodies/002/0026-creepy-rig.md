### Creepy Rig (Day 1)

This is the first day of learning to rig and animate.
I skipped making a good model because that's not what I'm focusing on.

I'm having more than a little trouble with it. It's actually sorta complicated,
I didn't have time to learn to do more than creating a skeleton and capture
the model onto the skeleton.

The eyes are particularly difficult, because I don't want them distorting
when the neck or head turns (duh).

For much of this, I'm following along with this [tutorial][fur_dude_tutorial].
