### Chattering Skull

Point of today's practice was to learn a bit about volumes in Houdini;
in particular animated volumetric fog with a time-based noise component.
(I want to revisit the mass relay when I have a better understanding of volumes
so I can create a reasonably convincing mass effect field.)

Originally this was going to be a "morsmordre" dark mark from Harry Potter,
but I don't have time for that today. I didn't model the skull itself (although I did
modify it because the one I downloaded wasn't hollow, so creating a volumetric fog
from it made it look like an x-ray of someone with a lead brain; also had to slice
off the jaw so I could animate it separately from the top.)
