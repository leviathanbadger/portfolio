### Creepy Rig (Day 3)

I'm going back to remodel parts, it's too difficult to rig effectively
when the model is crap.

So for today, I introduce... Crap 2.0. Now with feet, and a mouth (and tongue),
and arms (but no hands.)

I re-rigged the skeleton, but tomorrow I'll have to go back to readjust the
control rig and feet IK solver. I'll also try to rig the eyes so you can pick
a target point and have it look around. Also the thighs (above knees, below
hip) are so small as to be missing completely. Ah well, can't win 'em all.

Eventually I'll actually get it rigged. Then it's on to grooming (adding fur)
and possibly adding muscle. Or maybe I'll try for an animation before either
of those.

This whole process is so much harder than I expected, haha. Major props to
character modelers/riggers/animators. After all of that, if I'm still on my
"animate character" bent, I'll look at rigging and animating quadrupeds,
and other nonstandard rig types.

For much of this, I'm following along with this [tutorial][fur_dude_tutorial].
