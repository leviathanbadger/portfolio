### Creepy Rig (Day 2)

For today, I'm working on the animation rig and inverse kinematics.

I think the next couple days are not going to be very impressive, visually.
I'm struggling to understand a lot of this, and I can't afford to spend
a lot of time each day on it.

For much of this, I'm following along with this [tutorial][fur_dude_tutorial].
