### Procedural Power Line

It's a customizable digital asset, and I made it in a way that will easily adapt
new types of power poles (metal frame, taller/shorter, etc.) Also did more research
on terrain rendering, added some volumetric fog to make the distance a bit clearer.

The power cords are actually simulated cords so I'd get realistic gravity bends.
It's a somewhat expensive cooking operation so that's also optional. It's a really
fast asset without that, you can place down/move points on the input curve and
watch it update the result in realtime.

So you can prototype with a "line" wire for prototyping, then switch to the
simulated wire and cook the simulation before rendering.
