### Grandfather Clock

There are some creative liberties, skipping detail to save time.
I cut short modeling so I could focus on the animation.

This was the first time I've attempted an animation in Houdini, so I
wanted to make sure to give myself enough time.
(Even if the animation is a simple sin wave, with no keyframes to speak of.)

The final render has quite a few render artifacts, but I'm done working on it.
I'll do better for the next animated project I work on.
