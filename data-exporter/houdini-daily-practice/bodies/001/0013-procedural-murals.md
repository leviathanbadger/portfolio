### Procedural Murals

This may look simpler than the others. It was not.

Tomorrow I'm probably going to continue on this project, see if I can:

1. Parameterize and export this node network, so I can import it
   and use it in other projects
2. Attempt to figure out a way to generate the faces using some kind of cell
   division algorithm, rather than jittering the points on a grid
3. Look into getting this to work on a dynamically-sized canvas, rather
   than a fixed square as it is here
4. Look into getting this to work on a curved surface, like a vaulted ceiling
5. See if I can figure out how to bake normal and roughness maps so I can
   export a single two-tri primitive and use it in a game (it may not look it,
   but these are extruded tiles).
