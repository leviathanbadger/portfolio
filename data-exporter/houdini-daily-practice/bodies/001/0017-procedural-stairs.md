### Procedural Stairs

Might look simple, mostly today was taken up by research.
Had to figure out how to do this, it's harder than it looks.

Next time I'll add (or at least try to add)...

- Optional (configurable) backboard
- Optional (configurable) sideboard/railing (each side configurable separately -
  sideboard, sideboard+railing, none)
- Configure stair foot and head to have different widths (interpolate widths in
  between) - with options for configuring stair "end cap" shape
- Configure stair width interpolation using ramp for full customization
- Configurable stairwell supports (under staircase) or at least side paneling
  to hide the Harry-Potter hidey-hole
- Options for randomizing stairs a bit (warped/cracked boards, etc)
- UV mapping
- Higher-res rendering with lower-res game map (baked normal and color maps)
- ...Whatever else I think of.
