### Mardini 2024 - Feather Template

Today is day 23 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Feather
Template from Shape SOP node][feather-template-sop].

This one was fun to make, but I ended up spending more time than I can really afford to
on it. The whole point of practicing is to get faster and better, but I can't get close
to my vision for even simple projects without spending more and more time on it.

The feather tools new to Houdini 20 are kinda great, although I deliberately chose a
project that didn't require me to use the grooming tools. I also didn't attempt to
construct any of the feathers procedurally - they're all hand-crafted using the stock
reference image below. I assume grooming feathers is even harder than grooming hair
or fur, so I wisely "nope'd" away from that.
