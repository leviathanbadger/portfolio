### Stormveil Castle (Day 1)

For today, I'm just attempting to greybox the largest features and match cameras
with the reference screenshots I took from the actual game. I'll probably have
at least one more day of this before I start to attempt creating actual geometry.
At that point I don't really know what I'll do. In the game, the castle is
_extremely_ full of detail, of a kind that I'm not really sure how to reproduce
programmatically.

Still... it's also _too much_ detail for the original game designers to have
manually modeled by hand, so they must have done it procedurally in some way.
It's a challenge that I shall overcome!
