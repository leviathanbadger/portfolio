### Bookshelf (Day 3)

Added procedural books. Didn't turn out quite like I expected, but
it's not exactly bad. I think the covers are too glossy, and they
don't really look like books without more color variation and
texture. Also book titles are missing, which doesn't help.

Variation in book height and depth would also be nice.
