### Cluttered Desk (Day 4)

I'm planning to create a really high-resolution render of two of my projects, then order
a custom two-sided puzzle printed so I can assemble it in a physical form. Just on a whim.
I haven't decided what I'll do for the second side, but the first side will be a variation
on the solar system project I started back in May of last year.

I'm changing it from being an abstract solar-system render to being a desk/office view
with a cluttered desk, including scale models of the planets in the solar system only as
decorations.

Today I created the walls, floor, and ceiling in order to frame the render better.
Additionally, I created a curtain rod and attached some curtains to frame the window.
The window frame itself is empty, without any glass panes or window. I ran out of time.

The curtain was the part I was most excited to work on, because it allowed me to play with
another simulation that I've never touched before: Vellum cloth simulations. This wasn't
a great way to learn how to use Vellum, however, because I really wanted the curtains to
have cloth loops up at the top to hang it on the curtain rod. However, I lost several
hours because of this. The simulation kept detaching the loops from the rod while I
tried to brush the curtain behind the holdback. I eventually got a "close enough" result,
at which point I manually edited a few points so the curtain rod didn't show through where
the loops were supposed to hang.
