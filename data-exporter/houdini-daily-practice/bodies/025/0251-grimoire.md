### Grimoire

This is the twenty-first prompt of the [Nodevember 2025](https://www.nodevember-2025.com/),
"Grimoire".

I'll return to the 2024 prompts later, but since I skipped nodevember this year in
favor of writing 30k words in November, I'm going to go to the 2025 prompts and do
the 2024 prompts later.

I've been having difficulty returning to practice lately, and I eventually realized
that in part it's because I'm getting paralyzed by how much work it is to do a single
daily practice. So I'm going to limit myself to 2 hours per practice to make it easier to
get started and finish each day. I don't necessarily expect this to work very well,
because I'm a perfectionist, but it's worth a try.

The original goal was to make a book with an actual page flipping animation, but I spent
way too much time making variations on magical pages, so instead I threw together a vellum
simulation and took the first result without fine-tuning it.

I also used the opportunity to experiment more with the Drop & Render service for running
the simulation (it failed again and I had to get support to fix it, so instead I ran it
locally) and for rendering the frames themselves. 120 frames (four seconds worth) rendered
in about 20 minutes when it would have taken 6+ hours on just my computer. But, it took $45
worth of render credits, so there's that. Probably worth it given the right circumstances.

The magic symbols on the pages are copied from
