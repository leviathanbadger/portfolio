### 'The Shining' Elevator (Day 5)

Today I cheated and added the sofa I already created for another daily practice
([LPE Compositing, day 137][day-137]). I had to update it a tiny bit to change
the size and to improve the UV generation for it. The material for it is still
new, created in Substance painter.

I also created the small wooden side tables. They were pretty simple to make.
The material is also in substance painter, but there isn't a lot of detail so
it could probably have just been a simple wood texture.

I slightly adjusted the lighting and camera position to make it look better,
although it's taking it a bit away from the reference image.

Finally, I did a bit of work under the hood to prepare for the blood simulation.
None of it is visible in the rendered output at this point though.
