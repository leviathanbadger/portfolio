### Barrel (Day 1)

I wanted to get back into SOPs/digital asset creation so that I could
start to learn UV mapping for automated processes.

I can control the size and shape of the barrel using extracted parameters;
and the UV coordinates update correctly so no matter what parameters I
choose the barrel will render correctly.

Tomorrow I'll probably look at importing this into the Solaris scene/
render with Karma. It won't be visually distinct at all, but with the next
version of Houdini there's GPU rendering functionality in the Karma
renderer, so it should take less time to render many of the scenes I
create. More importantly, that's the direction the industry is going.
