### Mardini 2023 - Wave

Today is day 10 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "wave".

This one I didn't really have a plan for either. The most I knew was that I wanted to
learn how to use MOPs, which several people have recommended through their tutorials,
but which I've never touched before. So I just downloaded the plugin, read some of
the documentation, and started playing around.

First impressions are that it's not very responsive, and has a lot of caching issues.
You have to manually reset the cache often or you get an incorrect result - which threw
me off for a long time while I was trying to figure out what it was doing.

I also wanted to experiment with motion blur. I haven't made too many animations in
Solaris/Karma before, so I hadn't realized you have to add a "Motion Blur" node
explicitly to actually get motion blur, even though it's enabled in the render settings
by default.

The end result looks decent in stills, and fine in an animation. A certain part of it
animates too fast, so you can't tell what's going on and it looks like the tiles are
having a seizure.

I said I wasn't going to do another animation this week, didn't I? Well, I lied. I do
that a lot.
