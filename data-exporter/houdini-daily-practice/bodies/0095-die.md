### Die/Dice

For the last few weeks, I've been creating a small low-level 3D game engine built
with Rust and using Vulkan. At this point, I needed an OBJ file to load in order
to start building out the OBJ load functionality in the engine. I decided to create
a simple die model for this purpose, but I realized only afterward that I don't
have a workflow to texture it. Sure, I could throw it into Photoshop and fake it,
but that would cause issues with aligning pips, getting details to line up at seams,
and I kinda wanted to learn to do it the right way.

So, after creating the model in about 10 minutes, I researched tools and bought
the first one I found: Adobe Substance 3D Painter.
