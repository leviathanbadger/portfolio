### Mardini 2024 - Crowd MotionPath

Today is day 24 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Crowd
MotionPath SOP node][crowd-motionpath-sop].

I overscoped this project _big time_. I thought I wasn't, because I was using the
agent and crowd tools with a single agent, rather than creating an actual crowd, but
apparently because of that I thought it was acceptable to create a complecated
animation sequence for the character, attach a rigid packed geometry for the torch,
the character is holding, make another terrain, cut out a cave, build support struts
and scatter rocks in it, make a campfire and accompanying pyro simulation... and all
of that is before building the scene in LOPs to render it.

Basically I wasted about 8 hours on this, and I really can't afford to.

The so-called ["knight" model][knight-model] is from mixamo.

The [torch model][torch-model] is by Third_Fox on sketchfab.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
