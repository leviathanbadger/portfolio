### Bookshelf (Day 1)

Bookshelf based on the bookshelves I have in my room. I wanted to
add books today, but it took to long to make the bookshelf itself
along with the scene. So that'll be tomorrow.

Ignore the black spheres on each shelf. They're just placeholder
points containing details about the shelf dimensions for procedurally
generating the shelf contents (an activity for tomorrow.)

Took 21 minutes (even) to render using the Karma CPU renderer.

The Karma XPU renderer is a bit darker for some reason, but it only
took 59 seconds to render.
