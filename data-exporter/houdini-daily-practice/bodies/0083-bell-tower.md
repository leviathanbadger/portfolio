### Salmon Run Bell Tower (Day 1)

Random project. Just searched for a simple bell tower to try to create.
I thought that this one looked nice so I started working on it.

I didn't have much time to work on it today, so I only have the basic
structure completed. I made sure to add UVs and normals to everything,
but I suspect I'll have to fine-tune most of them before I'm done
anyway.

Next up: add more detail, set up render.
