### Mardini 2024 - Cloud Shape Generate

Today is day 14 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Cloud
Shape Generate SOP node][cloud-shape-generate-sop].

Clouds really are difficult to get right. I think in part that's because they're -
by their very nature - disconnected from whatever landscape they're supposed to be
a part of.

I didn't put a ton of effort into the landscape, since I knew it would be lit only
indirectly by a sunset, so most of the details wouldn't be super visible anyway.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
