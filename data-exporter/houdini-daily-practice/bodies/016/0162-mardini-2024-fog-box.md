### Mardini 2024 - Fog Box

Today is day 8 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Karma Fog
Box LOP node][fog-box-lop].

This might be my new least-favorite render in Mardini 2024. I got bogged down in trying
to make the log cabin, because I tried to make it too procedural and kept running into
issues with the Boolean SOP node. I wasted most of my time making the cabin, so I had
to throw in a placeholder cone for the trees, and I had to use some flat, unimaginative
materials for the terrain. I was also going to add more lighting to interact with the
fog better, but I had no time for that either.

So basically... it's a completely dead scene with what could _possibly_ be interpreted
as a cabin in the woods, if you're extremely generous.

These time deadlines really make it hard to get a good product. But it's good practice.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
