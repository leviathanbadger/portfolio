### Mardini 2023 - Round

Today is day 1 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "round".
I didn't have much time to work on today's entry, because most of the day my computer
was spinning it's wheels trying to render yesterday's practice. I was going for a
blood cell/fleshy feel; just abstract, nothing specific. Missed the mark a bit, haha.
Didn't turn out too badly, though it's not one of my best.

Today was my first attempt at using metaballs. It looked better in my head. If I had
more time I'd try to play with the generation to get more complex structures, and
maybe try to use some metaballs in subtractive mode.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].

AFterwards, I went back and created a short animation from it. Not a ton of effort,
I mostly wanted more practice using COPs, TOPs, and ffmpeg to automate rendering each
frame and encoding a video.
