### Mardini 2023 - Obtuse

Today is day 3 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "obtuse".

The inspiration for today's project was to recreate the radio tower/satellite dish
from the campaign of Titanfall 2. However, I couldn't find any good screenshots of it,
and I didn't have time to try to get there in-game and make one myself. Instead I took
another cool piece of concept art/fan art (not entirely clear which it is) that I found
while looking, and I used it for reference.

The satellite dish itself was _really_ fun to make. It's almost entirely procedural, so
I can reshape it or adjust the decay damage by changing a few parameters. I even went
overboard and made sure to UV every part of it, although I don't have the time I need
to actually create materials for it right now. I will likely come back to this project
at some point after March ends so that I can do it justice, rather than simply selecting
solid-color materials.

I also tried out the cloud tools for this project, which I've never touched before (that
I can recall.) It'll take some getting used to, it's easy to make something that looks
incredibly ugly with the cloud tools. Besides that, it's difficult to get a good-looking
shot with clouds in general. It messes up the lighting in your scene.
