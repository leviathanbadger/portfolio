### Mardini 2025 - Animatronic

Today is day 17 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "DANCE",
in the KineFX category.

The goal was to make a dancing animatronic creature. (A humanoid rabbit, in case you
couldn't tell by the image.) That way I could rig and animate it, and it won't look
terrible if the "dance" is jerky and unnatural, because that's kind of the point of an
animatronic dance.

However... I really should have planned this out better, because I spent all 4 hours
of my budgeted time sculpting the head, jaw, and eyes. Then I scrambled to figure out
how to rig and deform it, putting in minimal effort because by this point I was _very_
burned out on this project, and created a minimal effort dance animation.

This is my new least favorite project for the month. By far. It looks awful, and the
amount of effort it would take to make it look better is staggeringly high. I also
overscoped it, to a ridiculous degree. Believe it or not, before I started this I also
wanted to "throw together":

  - A quick groom - very light fur on just the head, (I've used the frooming tools
    maybe twice, ever, and I'm about as good with them as I am with the sculpt SOP.
    And I don't really have experience creating fur/hair materials in the LOPS context
    for the render either.)
  - A shrinkwrapped shirt to disguise the fact that the body has no fur. (I've never
    done this before at all, so it's all new and I suspect it would be very difficult.)
  - A quick vellum sim of a wire leading from a wall outlet to the back of the rabbit,
    so I could animate the rabbit moving back and forth and you could see the wire
    dragging across the ground behind it.

While I may come back to this eventually if only to attempt the shirt and/or the groom
(for practice, not because I'm expecting a good result) it's not going to happen this
month. This was an awful experience altogether. I regret everything.

New stuff:

  - Sculpting, again. This is only the second time using this node, and I'm getting better
    at it. Really! But... when I started I was terrible. So the end result is predictable.
  - Capture Packed Geometry SOP. Instead of using a joint capture method as you would use
    for real skin or other organic creature you were rigging, I'm treating each segment
    as a distinct, rigid object. I want them to be moved by the skeleton, but not deformed
    by them. This is a new workflow for me, and I had to figure it out as I went.
  - Used the animation editor a lot more than I have in the past. I don't generally animate
    things with keyframes, because it's hard to know what the end result will look like
    when you can't play it back in realtime. But I wanted to copy+paste chunks of animated
    sections, and the animation editor allowed me to do that easily.
