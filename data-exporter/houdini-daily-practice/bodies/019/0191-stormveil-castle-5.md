### Stormveil Castle (Day 5)

Today I:

  - Used a heightfield to make terrain behind gates more natural-looking.
  - Created my first attempt at a the gate geometry. Not really satisfied with how it turned out.
    Might look better with a texture though.
  - Add a little more detail above center gate.
  - Improved pilasters, with much more detail, parameterized scale, and UVs.
  - Cut out left-side doorway
  - Start to add (_very basic_) materials to various objects in the scene.

TODO in future days:

  - Add HDA for crenellations, add to spire
  - Add HDA for walls, start to add detail there
  - Add heightfield for ground in front of castle
  - Add ground to left of gate
  - Add HDA to create raised geometry fake bricks for blending bricks when brick wall bends
  - Use copernicus to create brick texture
  - Use copernicus to create wall relief texture
  - Use copernicus to create gate texture
  - Add fog in chasm so that you can't see down to where the geometry ends
  - Add large front arch for distant shots
  - Add banners to large exterior walls
  - Add procedural damage to banners
  - Add cloth simulation to banners
  - Add vertical brick decorations to arches under stairways
  - Add more distant spires seen only from distant shots
  - Add procedural wall damage *** this will be very hard
  - Add debris *** TODO subdivide
  - Add wall sconce
  - Add small brazier next to gate
  - Add flame simulations for braziers
  - Add wall decoration around gate
  - Add windows, pillaster, other wall decorations above gate
  - Improve skybox. (Use actual HDRI? Can I find one with the giant erdtree somehow?)
  - Add birds flying in the sky
  - Add distant trees behind gate
  - Look into blue noise
