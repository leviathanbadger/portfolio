### Sky City (Day 2)

Started work on a new HDA in the "sky city" project. This time it's a rope
bridge with wooden planks. The wooden planks are stubbed out for now, but
the rope itself seems to be working well enough, as well as the end posts.

This tool and the banister tool don't work perfectly together. If you look
closely, you can see that the end posts actually intersect with the banister,
although it's difficult to see that from a distance. I'll fix it on the
next day, along with modeling individual planks for the walkway, adding
knots to connect the rope segments, optimizing the simulation, adding
variety, etc.

One of these days I'll have to take a look at how rendering will work for
this as well.
