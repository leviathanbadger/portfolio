### Barrel (Day 2)

Today I imported this barrel asset into the Solaris scene and learned how
to configure its materials and render it with Karma. It's barely visually
distinct at all, but with the next version of Houdini there's GPU rendering
functionality in the Karma renderer, so it should take less time to render
many of the scenes I create. More importantly, that's the direction the
industry is going.

With the Karma renderer, I was able to configure a few settings that weren't
possible with the Mantra renderer. In particular, I added a small amount of
chromatic abberation (driving up the render time by an order of magnitude,
heh); as well as a dramatic bokeh/depth-of-field effect. The first render
is with the chromatic abberation, and the second is without it.
