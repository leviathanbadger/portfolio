### Globe (Day 2)

I went back to redo my daily practice from day 6; creating a globe from scratch.
Except this time, I added UVs so I could texture the globe itself, and I created all
of the materials myself rather than using built-in materials.

It's also animated, and done in a way that you can play it on a loop if you want to.
(Can't imagine why you would want to.)

It's rendered using the Karma XPU renderer, with MaterialX shaders.

I will probably continue the practice tomorrow and adjust the globe so I can get a bit
of displacement on the landmasses, and add in another sphere rendered with some kind
of translucent/refractive shader to make it look sorta like water for the oceans.

The earth texture is from [solarsystemscope.com][solarsystemscope-com]; the HDRI map is
from [polyhaven][polyhaven-reading-room].
