### Procedural Walkway (Day 3)

Walkway is using a bump map instead; additionally I improved the way the walkway
segments are generated so there's more variability in the sheets of metal used
to create it. Also The borders of each segment have a slight edge applied to
modify the bump map; it creates a slightly visible border in the hero shot, but
the fine detail is not really visible. Most of the effort I went through to
generate the bump map is wasted, you can't really see it much. Oh well.

Additionally I created more walkways, and started framing the entire scene by
creating the general shape of the walls and the offshoot tunnels leading from
the central chute.

I wanted to continue to render the project in Karma, but I think the bump map
is going to give me problems. It might be possible to work through it, but
Karma and Mantra are not one to one anyway, and I think for this project it
might be worth it just to stick with Mantra so I can focus on procedurally
generating the scene.

I spend a little time creating some lighting effects and volumetric fog to add
ambiance. It doesn't look great, but that might be because I'm missing quite a
bit of geometric detail in the first place. Or... you know... because I've
had very little practice with it and am therefore kinda awful at it.
