### Hell Gate

I'm loosely recreating a screenshot from Bethesda's Doom Eternal.

This is day one, there's far too much work to complete all of it in one day.
It's rendered in Karma, with the XPU renderer. It took 1:13 to render this output.
Note that the ground and rocky platform are using displacement maps. They look
low-resolution, because they are; the textures I got were free, I'd have to pay
to get higher-res versions of the same.

I'm not going to try for a 1:1 recreation of the detail, I just want it to look
_somewhat_ like the reference image.
