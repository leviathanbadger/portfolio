### Mardini 2024 - LABS Regions from Image

Today is day 30 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [LABS
Regions from Image SOP node][labs-regions-from-image-sop].

This practice refers back to [the first time][first-mosaic] I attempted to create a procedural
mural/mosaic. I spent three days' worth of practice refining it and making it into a digital asset.
Today, I generated the tiles in a completely different way. I don't actually think I did a better
job of it, despite all of the time between then and now. The algorithm I used to subdivide the
image into tiles was much better in the original version. However, I reached a comparable result
in less than two hours, compared to the (likely) 12+ hours combined to produce the result
originally.

Also, I deliberately used the labs lot subdivite SOP again in this practice, since I don't
believe I used it very effectively in yesterday's practice. It created interesting spiderweb
patterns in the tiles that I don't think I want. I would have gotten a better, more random-looking
result if I just used the voronoi fracture node like I did originally.

Only one day of practice left in Mardini. Then I stop playing with Houdini for about a month
while I focus on my move and recover from burning out because of doing too much crap at once.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
