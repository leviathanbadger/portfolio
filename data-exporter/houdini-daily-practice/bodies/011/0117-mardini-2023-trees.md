### Mardini 2023 - Trees

Today is day 12 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "trees".

This one took way too long. I was going to make two trees then create a hammock between
them, but I don't have time for that. The tree itself took a while to create because
the nodes I used are expensive and iterating on the tree took a long time.

The purpose was to practice with Labs tree generation nodes again, which I haven't touched
since creating the art-directed "tree with thigmatropism" practice more than a year ago.
This time I also created a Karma/MaterialX material to render it (including UV blending on
branch/trunk seams, subsurface scattering on leaves, etc).

To create the leaves I used a trace node for the first time, to create geometry from a
texture atlas containing about 15 different leaves.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
