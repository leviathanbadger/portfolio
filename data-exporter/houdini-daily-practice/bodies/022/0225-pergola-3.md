### Pergola (Day 3)

This is a continuation of the project from day 4 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025].
The prompt was "FOLIAGE", in the SOPS category.

Today I:

  - Adjusted column material and edge detail.
  - Add tile cracks (using OpenCL kernel to apply randomness and select between 25 crack textures).
    This was surprisingly difficult to do.
  - Add crappy initial wood texture for pergola struts.
  - Art-direct mountains, use copernicus to create terrain texture with better snowcaps.
  - Fix vine material (looked invisible sometimes depending on the light position.)
  - Add slap comp, mostly adjusting saturation and value. I have a very poor instinct for
    what looks good, so I'm mostly just trying different things. I increased the saturation
    overall, added a yellow tint, then decreased the value of the darker areas to make them
    darker still and increase the contrast.

Planned:

  - Add bench model and materials
  - Dirt/muddy tracks on floor
  - Add walkway stones
  - Improve the way that leaves are generated, use an actual texture for them.
  - Add transition between tile floor and grass/walkway stones
  - Add grapes to vines
  - Add flowers to bushes
  - Add grass texture (or actually model grass or something)
  - ...more
