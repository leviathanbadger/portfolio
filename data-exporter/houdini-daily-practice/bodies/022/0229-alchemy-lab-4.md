### Alchemy Lab (Day 4)

I'm getting back into Houdini practice using the [Nodevember 2024][nodevember-2024]
prompts. Although the prompts are meant to be completed in two days, I'm taking a more
leisurely approach and spending a week on each prompt to ensure I don't burn myself
out practicing while working full-time. This is the first day of the first prompt,
"Alchemy Lab".

Today I:

  - Improved table model, and added a procedural texture using copernicus. I was attempting
    to add more geometric detail via the texture rather than modeling it directly, but
    depending on the camera angle it can look a bit too flat. I may need to add some
    additional geometry to the table to make it look better from all angles; but I'm
    considering that out of scope for now.
  - Added brick texture to ceiling. Again, it doesn't look the best, but I suspect it'll
    look better once I add ominous lighting with scattered candles. (What's that? It
    doesn't make sense to have a vaulted brick ceiling, you say? Well, it's a fantasy
    alchemy lab, so it _could_ make sense in-world. Who the heck cares anyway?)
  - Added a much simpler material to the ceiling beams, walls, and shelves.
