### Alchemy Lab

I'm getting back into Houdini practice using the [Nodevember 2024][nodevember-2024]
prompts. Although the prompts are meant to be completed in two days, I'm taking a more
leisurely approach and spending a week on each prompt to ensure I don't burn myself
out practicing while working full-time. This is the first day of the first prompt,
"Alchemy Lab".

As I often do, for my ideation, I used ChatGPT to generate a sequence of reference images.
Rather than attempting to recreate any of the reference images exactly, the plan is to
use them as inspiration for the scene.

Since I plan on ~a week to work on this prompt, I decided to start by greyboxing the scene
and setting up the camera angles.

New stuff:

  - Shelf tool using an HDA. I've created HDAs before, of course, but not for a long time.
    The shelf geometry is actually very complex, and it has a lot of magic values that are
    hard to pin down correctly. The idea initially is to reduce the number of configurable
    parameters so I can play around with more shelf options to fine-tune how it looks
    without having to switch between a dozen or more different nodes to do so.
