### Alchemy Lab (Day 2)

I'm getting back into Houdini practice using the [Nodevember 2024][nodevember-2024]
prompts. Although the prompts are meant to be completed in two days, I'm taking a more
leisurely approach and spending a week on each prompt to ensure I don't burn myself
out practicing while working full-time. This is the second day of the first prompt,
"Alchemy Lab".

Today I:

  - Significantly improved the method for generating the hex rooms, including
    creating a new HDA for the hex room generator which allows for attribute-driven
    wall decorations. This means I can potentially create a lot of different
    or randomized wall decorations without having to manually specify each one;
    but I can still art-direct individual wall decorations by specifying
    attributes on the hex room geometry.
  - Improved the shelf HDA to allow for better generation of (and more customization
    for) the shelf geometry generated as a wall decoration on the hex room walls.
  - Separated the walls/ceiling/ceiling beams/shelves into separate
    geometry objects, so I can more easily control the materials and lighting
    for each part of the scene.
  - Added dummy materials for each object currently specified in the scene,
    so I can more easily visualize how the scene will look when rendered.

Frankly, it still kinda looks mostly like a greybox, but the technical implementation
is significantly improved, and I can now start to focus refining the meshes and generated
details for the scene. The last big thing missing before I can create textured materials
is adding UV generation to the entire scene, which I plan to do next.

Tomorrow I plan to add UV generation to most (if not all) of the scene, and then start
working on the Copernicus-generated materials. If I have time I'll try to add an initial
iteration of alchemy beakers/etc for placement on the table.

I can't really add lighting until I have candles, which will make creating materials
hard because the scene will be significantly darker than it is now. So it'll be a few
days still before I add real lighting, so the greybox look will continue for a while
longer.
