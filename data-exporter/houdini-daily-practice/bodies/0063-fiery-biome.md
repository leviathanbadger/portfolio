### Fiery Biome

Today I created a fiery/lava/volcano biome terrain and render using the same
tutorial series I used to create the dusty biome. It's interesting to learn
the ins and outs of terrain generation and rendering. I don't feel that this
turned out as well as the desert biome did, and it doesn't look as good as
the one created by the author of the tutorial series.

Well... I tried.

I do like how the lava turned out, although there are some fairly obvious
artifacts from the method I use to mask out the areas where the lava is
generated. I created a large portion of that myself, independently of the
tutorial series, because I wanted to experiment with making it bulge out
and look much more viscous.

I didn't put a humanoid in the scene for scale because the lava bulges out
about 10 metres... meaning adding the human for scale would just make the
entire scene look awful.

The terrain has a generated texture, similar to the one created for the
desert biome, but the emissive lighting from the lava and the low global
lighting makes it _really_ hard to see. Overall the experiment was a
failure, although the practice itself was a success. I learned quite a bit
from following along and making this.
