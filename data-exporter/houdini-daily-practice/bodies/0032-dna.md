### DNA

It looks decent enough as a still image. I also used a DOP network to animate it
being pulled off-screen, and that failed hardcore. Still, I rendered the animation anyway.
I'm inordinately proud of it no matter how messed up it is.

The simulation works almost exactly as I wanted it to; it's just that the DNA strands
themselves don't generate correctly on the deformed curve. I have a few ideas how to fix
it, but I likely won't return to this project. I'm not super invested in it; it was just
an interesting technical challenge that I completed (still image), then decided to try
for more (animation fail.) Aside from that I could also fiddle with the base pair variant
generation so there aren't as many long sequences of the same pair, but again, not really
that important to me.
