### Marble Bowl

Today's practice was small and simple. I created a small bowl filled with marbles.
The marbles are positioned using a simple rigidbody physics simulation so they're
mostly settled into natural positions. This is very similar to the
[decorative rocks][decorative_rocks] simulation created for an earlier practice,
but the purpose is different. Instead of creating procedural decorative rocks,
I left the marbles as a fixed sphere so I could export the positions, orientations,
and colors to experiment with instanced rendering in my vulkan-rust game engine
project. Additionally, I created a PB material using Adobe Substance Painter for
the bowl that uses a normal map to add additional detail that doesn't exist in
the geometry itself.
