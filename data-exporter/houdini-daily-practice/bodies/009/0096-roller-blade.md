### Roller Blade

Today's practice had nothing to do with Houdini, actually. I wanted to follow along
with a tutorial series so I could learn how to use Adobe Substance 3D Painter without
wasting a lot of time guessing how things worked. It paid off, because I learned a
lot of nifty features and tricks that I wouldn't have even thought to try. This
means that I didn't create the roller blade model itself, just the material.

Although I followed along with the tutorial, I did make sure to make it my own.
Almost all of the materials I picked are different from those chosen in the tutorial.
The one part that's clearly not adjusted in any way is the blue patch on the side,
which I didn't have an alternative to and I don't know how to make. For the next
few days I may spend time trying to learn Substance Designer since it will complement
learning Substance Painter (and it came with the software bundle).
