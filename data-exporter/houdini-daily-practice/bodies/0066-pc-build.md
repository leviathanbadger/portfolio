### PC Build (Day 1)

Recreating my new PC build in Houdini. Again, not going for a 1:1 copy,
just something similar. This is day 1, and I haven't practiced in about
two months, so I focused entirely on just the case frame for now.
Tomorrow I'll add more detail, including the front panel, and fiberglass
panes on the sides and front.
