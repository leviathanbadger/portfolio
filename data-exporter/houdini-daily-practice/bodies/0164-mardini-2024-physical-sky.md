### Mardini 2024 - Karma Physical Sky

Today is day 10 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Karma
Physical Sky LOP node][physical-sky-lop].

I have used this node for several projects before, including a few in this Mardini.
Knowing this prompt was coming up just made it natural to practice with it beforehand.
It's been very helpful, and often produces better results than an actual HDRI image.
HDRIs seem to be too low-resolution to seem like they're actually part of the scene,
so rendering them as actual geometry often hurts the final result. But this node
seems to make a much better dome light to render, possibly because it's entirely
procedural so it can go up to whatever resolution is needed to create a good result.

Because I've already used the node, I decided to put some effort into learning the
procedural ocean tools for the Karma renderer. I struggled for some time before I
attempted an actual render and realized that the procedural ocean doesn't render
to the highest quality in the viewport, but the result was actually really good in
the final render.

The project turned out well, even if I did run out of time to fiddle with depth-of-field
settings or add clouds. I threw in an ocean waves sound effect in After Effects to
complete the result. Credit for the [ocean waves foley][ocean-waves-foley] goes to
