### Globe (Day 3)

Continued playing around with the globe I created. This time I used cops to create
a cartoony displacement map so that I could render the continents displaced; and I
added a translucent water body for the ocean, so there should be some subsurface
effects; and procedurally generated a volumetric cloudscape for the earth (again,
cartoony and very out of scale.)

It's animated in a loop again, although this time in rendering it I'm cheating a bit
and rendering with significantly lower-quality render settings, offset by a denoising
step for each frame.

It's rendered using the Karma XPU renderer, with MaterialX shaders. For one frame,
I attempted to do something fancy and expensive using features that aren't supported
by the XPU; but it took almost two hours to render the single frame because it was
limited to run only on the CPU. Additionally the clouds in that one, although they
look more appropriate to the scale, and much brighter (as I intended), also ended up
looking very streaked away from the globe. Not something I couldn't fix given time,
but with it rendered on the CPU it didn't seem worth it when compared against being
able to animate a whole sequence of frames.
