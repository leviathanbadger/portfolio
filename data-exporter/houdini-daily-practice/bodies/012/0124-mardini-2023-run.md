### Mardini 2023 - Run

Today is day 19 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "run".

I decided to interpret the prompt abstractly - as in, a long but mostly straight
path that's daunting or time-consuming to traverse. Think "salmon run", for example.
Or "the Kessel run" if you're a Star Wars fan.

Thinking about it more, I eventually decided to try to recreate a frame from the
Andor TV show - in spirit, if not particularly faithfully. Which means it's now
tangentially connected to a tangent of the prompt. This would be a problem if I
anticipated winning, but since I really don't I don't think it'll be an issue,
haha.

The difficulty in this one isn't modeling everything. Pretty much everything in
the scene is full of hard lines and hard geometry that can be modeled relatively
simply using polygons and boolean nodes. The difficulty is that rendering it
involves exclusively using indirect lighting. In the reference image The directional
light from the sun is diffused - presumably by a pane of glass or other transmissive
material out of frame. The ceiling lights don't really contribute to the lighting
in the reference image, but I wanted them to contribute in the render, mostly
becauseI'll need something similar for a more complicated project I have coming up
next week.

The render scheduler is saying it'll take about 8 hours to complete the render.
I expected it to take a while, because if the indirect lighting, so I'm skipping
PDG/TOPs for this practice so that I can get 5-minute interval frame updates in
case the render crashes.
