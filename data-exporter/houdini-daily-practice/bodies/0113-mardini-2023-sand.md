### Mardini 2023 - Sand

Today is day 8 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "sand".

My response to the prompt is to create an hourglass, and simulate the grains of sand
running from the top to the bottom. I had the idea to color the grains at the final
frame of the simulation, then apply the color back to the same granes of sand at
previous frames, making the sand look mixed and disorganized at the beginning but
magically fall into place in a beautiful pattern at the end. I thought this would
be difficult, but turns out it was super easy, barely an inconvenience.

I've technically never used Vellum grains for a project before. I considred it for
the mud sim, before realizing that a viscous liquid would model it better and likely
produce better results. I'm actually _really_ liking the Vellum suite of simulation
tools, and I haven't even done anything really complicated with it.

That said... the down side for this project is that the animation ended up being almost
exactly five minutes long. Which is a problem, because this is a daily practice thing,
and with each frame at 20 seconds that gives me a 60-hour render time (conservative).
I have that time before I need to turn in the animation, but if I do it I won't be
able to use my computer for all of that time, which seems like a very poor use of
resources considering I'm trying to get a backlog of practices done early so I am not
distracted from work when it starts on the 16th.

There are two videos here. The first is a massively sped-up version (1200% faster)
so you can watch the hourglass draining over the course of 18 seconds, instead of
3-4 minutes. If you _do_ want to watch the full thing, that's what the second video
is for.
