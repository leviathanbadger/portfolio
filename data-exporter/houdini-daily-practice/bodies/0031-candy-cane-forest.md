### Candy Cane Forest

Inspired by the candy-cane forest from Wreck-it Ralph.

I had some difficulty with the terrain generation in attempting to prevent the
scatter from placing candy canes in the lake area; I mostly got it working using
a heuristic, but not incredibly well.

The candy canes are instanced, and there are about a hundred variants of candy
cane, but I should have probably invested in creating variants that are visually
distinct, not just proportionally distinct.

I tried to generate the small lake using a fluid simulation, but it didn't work
out well.
