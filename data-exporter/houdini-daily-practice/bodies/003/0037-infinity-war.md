### Infinity War Dissolve Effect (Day 1)

This is part one of an attempt at recreating the dissolve effect shown in the
end title screen in the Marvel movie "Avengers: Infinity War".

While I had hoped to complete the project today, that's not how it ended up going.
I managed to create a pyro simulation for the title screen text; however, the
simulation generated smoke that didn't interact with the text that was still solid.
I ran out of time, so I had to split the project into an additional day, possibly
two.
