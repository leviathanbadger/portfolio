### Shardblade

This is a shardblade, based (very) loosely on King Elhocar's blade "Sunraiser",
from Brandon Sanderson's "The Stormlight Archive".

I didn't have much time to look into something new today, so instead I focused
on learning the basic geometry modeling tools better. I'm not happy with the
materials I threw together for the render, and there are quite a few elements
of detail I wanted to add but didn't have time for. I may return at a later
date to fix it up again.
