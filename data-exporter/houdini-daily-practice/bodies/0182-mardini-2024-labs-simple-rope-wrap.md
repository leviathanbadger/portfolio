### Mardini 2024 - LABS Simple Rope Wrap

Today is day 28 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [LABS
Simple Rope Wrap SOP node][labs-simple-rope-wrap-sop].

Almost ran out of energy to do this practice. Again, lots of these LABS tools are very
useful... situationally. Let's face it - there just aren't that many situations where
wrapping a rope around something is particularly necessary. Sure, it's nice to have
the tool for when it's needed, but it's just... so very infrequently needed.

I like the result, but mostly because of the random other crap I added to frame the
centerpiece, not because of the centerpiece itself.

The grass turned out decently well. I could have used the grass models I've previously
purchased, but I figured the detail would look out-of-place in the context of everything
else, so I refrained and generated a bunch of grass variants myself. It does end up
having a little too much grey, probably because I didn't configure the subsurface
scattering correctly; and some of the grass is visible through the concrete, probably
because the "ambient occlusion" mask by feature is too forgiving about points close
to an obstacle. But for 2-3 hours of work it's fine.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
