### Mardini 2025 - Pergola

Today is day 4 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "FOLIAGE",
in the SOPS category.

Today's project was supposed to be an animation of a tree growing, because it sounded
fun and I had an idea for how to do it. However, after playing around with it for half
an hour I realized that such a math- and simulation-intensive project would not be
feasible to complete in a short time frame. I just don't have time right now,
especially given that I took 7-8 hours on yesterday's project and I had only budgeted
for four.

So instead, I made a pergola. (Not a pagoda, which I thought they were called, but
that's apparently a different thing entirely. Haha.) It's still kind of biting
off more than I can chew, but it's easier to cut corners with and still have a
finished product, unlike a tree growing simulation that never materializes right.
I'll go back and do the tree growing project at some point when I'm not on such
a ridiculous time crunch.

New stuff:

  - I'm counting the bushes and vines as "new stuff", because I've never actually
    modeled foliage before. (At least, not without using specialized tools that do
    most of the heavy lifting for you.) It's not a new tool or technique, just a
    very novel way of using all of the previous ones. I think it turned out well,
    although I _did_ cheat a bit by just using quads for the leaves. Hey, it's
    stylistic, not cheap. (Or maybe it's stylistic _and_ cheap.)
  - I technically used a Karma Atmosphere LOP, although I used it without much
    research and mostly fumbling in the dark. The results weren't ideal, in part
    because I had no idea what settings to change to achieve the effect I was
    trying for.
