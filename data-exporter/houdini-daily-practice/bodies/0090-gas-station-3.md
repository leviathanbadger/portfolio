### Gas Station (Day 3)

Continuing the gas station project I started about three weeks ago. It's an
ambitious project compared to many of the projects I start. The deeper I get
into the weeds the more I realize I have to dig to get an acceptable result.

Today I specifically created a tool to generate the beverage fridges lining
the back and side walls in the gas station. I was going to spend some time
creating beverage assets to fill out the scene, but just the fridges themselves
took significantly longer than I expected. I'm not upset with the result, just
the time it took to get there.

Again, the materials aren't great. I also didn't put in effort to fix the scene
lighting, so the details that do exist aren't highlighted well. All for later
practice sessions.
