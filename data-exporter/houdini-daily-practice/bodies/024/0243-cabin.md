### Cabin

This is the thirteenth prompt of the [Nodevember 2025](https://www.nodevember-2025.com/),
"Cabin".

I'll return to the 2024 prompts later, but since I skipped nodevember this year in
favor of writing 30k words in November, I'm going to go to the 2025 prompts and do
the 2024 prompts later.

I've been having difficulty returning to practice lately, and I eventually realized
that in part it's because I'm getting paralyzed by how much work it is to do a single
daily practice. So I'm going to limit myself to 2 hours per practice to make it easier to
get started and finish each day. I don't necessarily expect this to work very well,
because I'm a perfectionist, but it's worth a try.

This is Hagrid's hut, obviously. Couldn't you tell?

Out of time for a workday though, so the render is crap. It took three hours, which is
way more than I would have expected considering I spent literally five minutes on the
actual render (this part you probably can tell). The problem (if it is a problem) is that
the modeling process for this is actually surprisingly difficult. It required several new
techniques that I didn't anticipate, and even some linear algebra in one place to
correctly position the door.

Oh yeah, I got to reuse the pumpkin HDA from
[day one](https://brandonslade.me/houdini-practice/231). Huzzah!
