### Groom Rubber Toy

Today I took a short break from working on the sky city in order to learn
about the grooming tools in Houdini. I was mostly following a tutorial,
although I did have to fiddle a bit on my own to experiment with rendering.
Additionally, the tutorial didn't mention how to get it to avoid generating
fur on parts of the skin (such as the eyes, or the spines on the back.)

I didn't create the model, that's just one of the test geometries that
comes with Houdini. The purpose was to play around with grooming tools,
not to create a model from scratch.
