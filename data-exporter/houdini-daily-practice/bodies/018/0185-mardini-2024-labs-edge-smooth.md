### Mardini 2024 - LABS Edge Smooth

Today is day 31 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [LABS
Edge Smooth SOP node][labs-edge-smooth-sop]. The last day.

I'm mostly busy today preparing for my move, so I'm a little delayed on getting this
up. Originally I was going for a droplet, from the 3 body problem series (first seen
in The Dark Forest), but I realized after a short time that 1. it's actually very
difficult to model a "droplet" shape, and 2. I misunderstood what the edge smooth
node would do, and 3. an entirely reflective teardrop shape would be very difficult
to see in the void of space anyway.

I still kept most of it, because again, I don't have time to completely scrap everything.
Also I threw in an animation (quick & dirty) to make the profile of the ship more obvious.
Still, it's probably one of my worst practice sessions of this Mardini. I stopped having
fun with it a week or two back. At least I'm finally done.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
