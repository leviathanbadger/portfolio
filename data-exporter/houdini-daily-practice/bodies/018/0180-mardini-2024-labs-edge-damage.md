### Mardini 2024 - LABS Edge Damage

Today is day 26 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [LABS
Edge Damage SOP node][labs-edge-damage-sop].

Full disclosure, I _barely_ use the edge damage SOP in this project. It adds a very small
amount of variation in the silhouette profile, but not really a ton. You can't really see
it in the final result, but I actually started this project with a really nice procedural
2D city builder algorithm. I think there's reall potential there, but unfortunately I
don't have to explore it. Even for procedural systems like that, it takes a good deal of
time to manually create each of the components that are used as building blocks to create
the final result. And it takes a lot of fine-tuning to make the algorithm foolproof and
scalable too.

Eventually I ran out of time so I just threw together what I already had, added the edge
damage SOP, and rendered out a silhouette view of the skyline.
