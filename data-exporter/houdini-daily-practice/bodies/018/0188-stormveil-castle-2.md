### Stormveil Castle (Day 2)

Still greyboxing, for the most part. Today I:

  - Added additional castle spires and walls, adjusted vanguard wall spire positions.
  - Added the right-side stairs and platform
  - Better arch for entry gate
  - Added entryway banisters, stairs, and some rock decorations that I think
    are meant to prevent erosion. (Or at least, that's what purpose they would serve
    if it were real life, and not just a game with a bunch of static geometry.)

I did end up going into waaay too much detail on some of the ground geometry.
