### Mardini 2023 - Rough

Today is day 4 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "rough".

I made a slot canyon. Originally I was going to create a cartoon-looking material using
the UV coordinates on the walls to create striations from a color ramp. However, I
accidentally stumbled on this look while I was messing with the material parameters,
and I rolled with it.

The thing I learned today that I'd never done before: cameras have a "background image"
and "foreground image" parameter that can point at a COP. Additionally, the Ramp COP
can be used to generate a radial/concentric gradient.
