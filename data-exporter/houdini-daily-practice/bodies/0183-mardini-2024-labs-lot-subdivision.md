### Mardini 2024 - LABS Lot Subdivision

Today is day 29 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [LABS
Lot Subdivision SOP node][labs-lot-subdivision-sop].

I wanted to make an "abandoned city" view, except that I don't have time or energy to
build everything. It's not a bad stopping point if you consider it the first day in a
multi-day project, but it's meant to be a finished product on its own for Mardini.

I ran out of time again, except this time it's more obvious that I have an unfinished
product. It doesn't look terrible, it's just clear that the buildings are greybox, and
there's little to no detail. At least there's texture on the ground. I want to
experiment more with procedural textures/displacement; this is just me getting my
toes wet on the concept, but not really doing anything innovative or even good.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
