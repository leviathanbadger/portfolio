### Pinwheel

I was intending to add ground detail and some kind of terrain in the distance on the horizon, but I
burned out after making the pinwheel itself.

Technical things I worked on here:

  - Thin-walled geometry with a different "material" for front- and back-faces
  - Motion blur (it's an animation, but it starts still and picks up speed.) This time I couldn't
    just use velocity blur because the pinwheel spins too fast, and the shutter speed is too large.
    It would have looked incredibly wonky.
