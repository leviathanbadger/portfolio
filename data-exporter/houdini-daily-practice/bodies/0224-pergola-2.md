### Pergola (Day 2)

This is a continuation of the project from day 4 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025].
The prompt was "FOLIAGE", in the SOPS category.

I really liked the original project, but the result was not what I'd wanted in
almost any sense. I had to keep the scope low in order to get a finished product
for the competition, so I cut corners just about everywhere.

So now I'm coming back to this project, but this time I'll spend several days
on improving it, a little bit at a time. I'm focusing on 2-3 things each day,
rather than incrementally improving everything all at once.

Today I:

  - Made the modeling of the pergola a bit more procedural - fewer hardcoded values.
  - Adjusted the pergola dimensions (mostly reducing the hight, to make it appear
    wider without increasing the simulation size.)
  - Added detail to the column base, made column tops more consistent.
  - Added procedural materials using Copernicus COPs nodes for the floor and
    columns.
  - Add bushes on all sides (not just two) with gaps for walkways.
  - Adjusted vine simulation, gave the vines a more variable thickness so they
    aren't 100% width when the draping vines end.
  - Deleted the grass, which was completely unrecoverable due to it being a
    placeholder and ugly AF to boot.
  - Adjusted sun position, camera positions, several of the other (very much
    temporary) render materials.
