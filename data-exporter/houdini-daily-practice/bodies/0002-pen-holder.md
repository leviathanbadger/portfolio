### Pen Holder

I didn't bother to measure the dimensions, but it's close enough.

Also it's white instead of black because I'm still really unclear about the rendering system in Houdini... haven't gone into materials, lighting, cameras, etc. pretty much at all.

Also it's 24k polygons. Yikes. Maybe good for prerendered cutscenes or film, but definitely not for games.
