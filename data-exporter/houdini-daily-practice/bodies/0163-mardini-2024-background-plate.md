### Mardini 2024 - Background Plate

Today is day 9 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Background
Plate LOP node][background-plate-lop].

I've never used this node before, so I wasn't really sure what it was for. After using it,
I'm still not sure I completely understand what it does, but I'm pleasantly surprised by
what can be accomplished by it. Unfortunately, it's basically impossible to use without
the help of external tools like Blender or After Effects to do camera tracking. I suppose
you could use fSpy for still images, but even then you're using an external tool to match
the camera in Houdini to the scene.

Still, it's an interesting tool to use, and I'll definitely keep it in mind if I ever do
video editing in the future. It doesn't really work for most of my workloads though,
because I typically don't use video to begin with.
