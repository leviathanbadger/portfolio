### Mardini 2024 - LABS Simple Shapes

Today is day 25 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [LABS
Simple Shapes SOP node][labs-simple-shapes-sop].

Again, wasn't really sure where I was going with this one. It's like the topobuild node:
I can see it being a good node if used well, but it's too low-level to use as a seed
for an art project. I could pick a random thing to render, but it's hard to use a node
intentionally in a random project if you don't already use it as a matter of course.

Eventually I made an animation, which is bad because it takes a long time to render,
but fine because I didn't spend more than 1.5 hours on this practice. I only spent this
long because I got stuck in lookdev getting it to actually appear nice. Not sure I
actually succeeded, but we'll see how it turns out.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
