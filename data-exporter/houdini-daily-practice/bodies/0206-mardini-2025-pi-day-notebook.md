### Mardini 2025 - Pi Day Notebook

Today is day 14 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "GRAFFITI",
in the SOPS category.

Today is also Pi day, which I often forget to celebrate until it's too late. But not
this time!

This took a bit longer than I wanted, but I'm still technically within my time budget.
It's the last day of week 2 of Mardini, and the next two weeks are moving on to
KineFX and DOPS as the weekly theme. I'm anticipating that on average many of those
days will be significantly harder than this weeks' and last weeks' practices, so I'm
glad to still be almost two practice days ahead of schedule. Gives me some time to
lose to simulations or rendering multiple frames that I've not had to spend on most
of the previous days.

New stuff:

  - Mostly just new ways of doing COPS stuff. Practicing with all of the same nodes
    but different contexts and requirements force me to use them in new ways. This
    time I had to adjust UV coordinates manually from a rasterized geometry in order
    to get the ramp below the pi symbol in the correct location. I also had a lot of
    back and forth trying to get the red inside of the pi symbol to look something
    like a berry filling for pie.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].

Now! Time for some pie.
