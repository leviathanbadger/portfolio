### Chair

This was by far the hardest one to make. The back is curved, and the seat is even more so.

I don't know how to set up UVs yet or I'd look for a wood texture rather than a solid color.
This is good enough for now. Maybe I'll revisit it later.

Only 430 polygons, so definitely reasonable for a game.
