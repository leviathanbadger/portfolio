### Dusty Biome

I haven't completed the last bit of the tutorial series on rendering, but despite
that I started on a new project. I found a good tutorial series on generating
and rendering terrain. I've had a lot of trouble with this in the past, so it
made sense to start on this tutorial series.

Today I created the terrain itself, and procedurally generated a 4k texture to use
as the terrain base color.

For the dusty biome, I still have to scatter decorations (such as rocks/cactuses),
and then I need to figure out how to set up an actual render pipeline so the terrain
isn't just a flat base color.
