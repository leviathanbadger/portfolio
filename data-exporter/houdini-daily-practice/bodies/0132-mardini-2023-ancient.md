### Mardini 2023 - Ancient

Today is day 27 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "ancient".

I didn't put a ton of effort into this one. I'm getting busy with work again now
that I'm not pseudo-retired, and I don't have enough free time to work on Houdini
as much as I did at the beginning of the month. But I still have five more art
projects to work on for Mardini (four after this one) so I can't put it down yet.

Problem is, the last projects are themed around worlds. They're likely to be hard
(or at least time-consuming) to model, specifically because they have to be full of
detail. I'm burning out towards the end of the month because I don't have enough
time to work on this, and work on work, and relax. So I'm cutting corners as best
I can to make sure I finish on time without losing all of my energy.

For this prompt, I had the idea to model stonehenge, because I can get
something that looks decent and is obviously remeniscent of stonehenge without
looking anything like it. If you actually compare this to the reference image
you'll see what I mean.

I practiced the basics here. Nothing at all fancy or new, just re-treading old
ground on a new project.
