### Chess Capture

Today I continued the tutorial series on rendering. (Day 3)

The focus today was on motion blur/velocity blur; as well as rendering volumes
in karma.

Again, I didn't make the assets or chess piece materials for today's practice;
but I did make the render material for the smoke effect.

The animated frames only encompassed a single second, so in After Effects I
applied a time remap effect so I could play the clip forward and back a few
timeswithout the video ending and looping depending on the video player.
