### Mailbox (Day 2)

Today I extracted the mailbox into several HDA tools, and added more variation
so that I could set up a scene with about a thousand mailboxes; which I then
rendered.

The XPU renderer takes about four seconds on my new GPU. (But, of course, still
ignores the spot light.)

The CPU renderer takes just over a minute to render the same scene.
