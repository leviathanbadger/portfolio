### Chess Board

Today I continued the tutorial series on rendering.

Specifically, today I learned more about lighting and cameras for the
Karma renderer, as well as some more advanced rendering setups for it.
This scene has a few types of light, as well as a camera with a focal
distance (depth of field).

Again, I did not model anything here. For today, I also did not create
the materials, just the lighting and camera.
