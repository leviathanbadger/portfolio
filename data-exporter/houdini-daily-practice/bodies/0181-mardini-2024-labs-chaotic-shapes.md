### Mardini 2024 - LABS Chaotic Shapes

Today is day 27 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [LABS
Chaotic Shapes SOP node][labs-chaotic-shapes-sop].

This node is nominally really cool, but in practice it's _waaay_ too opinionated to have
a practical use. This might be because of my short time limit, or a lack of creativity on
my part, or my missing experience using point clouds instead of actual geometry to
build and render a scene... but ultimately it comes down to this being one of the worst
practices so far this month. Not _the actual worst_, but definitely it's in the bottom
five.

I do appreciate learning about a new node that may be useful in some extremely rare
corner cases in the future.

Also, in this practice, I learned how to programmatically create a bezier curve, which
will definitely be useful in the future, even if this node's utility is still dubious.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
