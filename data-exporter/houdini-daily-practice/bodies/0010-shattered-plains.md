### The Shattered Plains

These are recognizably renditions of the Shattered Plains, from Brandon Sanderson's "The Stormlight Archive".

...if each plateau in the shattered plains were a different color, and they were made
of a slightly-too-shiny clay.

I spent almost 5 hours on this. I keep planning projects to "challenge" myself,
Then realizing that even with my practice I still only have less than two weeks of experience;
and therefore have nowhere near the amount of experience required for a lot of what I try to do.

The better version (more detail, less clay) was actually an earlier version;
but for some reason it's refusing to render in color.
Also not sure why it's streaking lines down the chasm sides.
