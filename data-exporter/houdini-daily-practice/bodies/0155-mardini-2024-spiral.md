### Mardini 2024 - Spiral

Today is day 1 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [Spiral SOP
node][spiral-sop].

I don't have a lot of time this year to create projects for Mardini. Last year I had
no work for the first half of the month because I was in-between jobs, but this year
I have to balance my time between work, preparing to move, and this competition. So...
many of my entries will be sub-par, by my own standards. Where I'd normally put in
more effort to shore up issues, this year I'll have to optimize how I spend my time
in order to create an entry for every day.

Today's project I used the spiral SOP for the first time. It's an interesting node,
with obvious applications, but I have to admit the applications are still fairly
limited. The node itself isn't doing much that can't be done with (at most) 10
minutes of time writing VEX.

It should (hopefully) be obvious that the art is a soft-serve chocolate ice cream cone.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
