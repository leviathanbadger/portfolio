### Mardini 2025 - Snow Globe

Today is day 27 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "SNOW",
in the DOPS category.

I really need to learn to stop overscoping my projects. I didn't do a practice
yetsrday to try to get my sleep schedule back on track, and it seemed to work,
but today I had such a great idea for that I wanted to build, and I still
cut out many things I originally wanted to add; but it's nearly 2 AM and here
I am, writing out my report while waiting for it to render.

I could do the report in the morning, but this specific project is incredibly
expensive to render, even for a stillframe.

My Houdini started to repeatedly crash towards the end of the practice session,
which is making my mood black despite the project turning out - in my opinion -
really well. I'm not sure what exactly caused the crashing, but to fix it I
reduced the heightmap resolution, deleted and recreated several parts of the
material linker,

New stuff:

  - Labs Snow Buildup SOP - I've never had te occasion to use this before. It's a very
    nice tool for a very specific purpose, but I have to admit it's missing some
    functionality that I would have expected from it. Still, it gives a nice result
    in the cases that it does support, with added detail that I really appreciate.
  - Chroma Key COP - I wanted more glow on the windows, and less on the reflections
    of the scene lights you can see on the top of the globe. So I chroma keyed the
    yellow/orange windows, inverted the matte, and used that as the mask for a
    stronger glow affecting only them.
