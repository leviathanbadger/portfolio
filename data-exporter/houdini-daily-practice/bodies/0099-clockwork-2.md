### Clockwork (Day 2)

I had about three things I wanted to do today, and I thought each of them would
be relatively small. I only got the first one done, and it took about four hours
to do.

As you can see, the gears now have an actual material instead of just a solid
color and fixed metallic value. The material was created in Adobe Substance
Painter, and it includes maps for anisotropic angle and level. In order to get
this to work, I had to update the mesh generator several times. It turns out,
even with a texture map to specify these values, long, skinny triangles still
warp the output result in incredibly noticable and ugly ways.

Even after working for about four hours on this, there are still two fairly
noticable visual artifacts on the gears. I may or may not attempt to fix these
on a later date - I want them fixed, but I'm burning out on this project because
I bit off more than I can chew. I'm trying to do too many new things at once.
