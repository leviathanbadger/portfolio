### Mardini 2025 - Khonshu Altar

Today is day 7 of [Mardini 2025][mardini-2025]. The prompt for today is "CREATURE",
in the SOPS category.

Today I wanted to make a model of Khonshu, the moon god from Moon Knight. There were
several big challenges here, and I had a hard enough time just making the head, because
I've never really played with the Sculpt SOP before (I prefer modeling using procedural
tools) so after I spent two hours making a skull that vaguely looks like Khonshu's head,
I pivoted and abandoned his body in favor of making an altar and setting his head and
scepter on it.

At long last, I've finished one of these projects within the allocated time. I feel so
accomplished, which is great because I'm only a week into this Mardini and I'm otherwise
feeling extremely drained due to also working full time and dealing with visits to the
dentist in the meantime.

New stuff:

  - Mostly the new learning is how to use the sculpt SOP in Houdini. Creativity isn't one
    of my strong suits, so I prefer procedural and programmatic paradigms where possible;
    but in this case to accomplish what I want it just had to be sculpted. It wasn't as
    hard as I thought it would be; maybe in the future I won't try so hard to avoid it.
    (That said, sculpting a skull for a fictional creature is much harder to get wrong
    than other organic curves for, say, a human or a dog. So I still have to pick and
    choose.)
