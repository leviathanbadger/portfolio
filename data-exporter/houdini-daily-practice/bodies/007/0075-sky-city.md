### Sky City (Day 1)

Starting work on a several-day project to recreate this "sky city"
scene from the assets pack in the Unreal Engine marketplace (link
included on this page.)

I didn't have a ton of time to work today, so I didn't focus on
rendering at all. Instead, here's an HDA to generate the banister
as seen on the left side of the reference image.

Tomorrow I'll probably add a bit of variation here, as well as
creating a separate digital asset for the chasm bridges.
