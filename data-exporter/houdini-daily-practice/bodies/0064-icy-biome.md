### Icy Biome (Day 1)

Today I created the heightmap for an icy/mountain/tundra biome terrain. I
also set up the basics for a render, including the displacement material,
cameras, and lighting. This is set up using the same tutorial series I used
to create the dusty and fiery biomes on previous days.

There is no texture yet (other than the displacement heightmap) because I'm
out of time to practice today. So that, as well as scattering trees and
other decorations, will come on a later day. (Possibly tomorrow.)
