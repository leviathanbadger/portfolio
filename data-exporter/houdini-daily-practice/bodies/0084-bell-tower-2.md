### Salmon Run Bell Tower (Day 2)

It was actually much harder to get this rendering properly than I expected.
I believe it's the project I've had with the largest number of disperate
materials I needed to configure. In addition, I had significant trouble
getting displacement to work on the tower because many of the tower parts
were generated without regard for n-gons, and apparently displacement doesn't
work well with polygons with more than four sides.

I also added much more detail, refining the roof especially. And added a
ground plane and decorative rocks to break up the ground and give it scale.

Altogether all of this took about five hours, which is about twice what I
was expecting.

Still to do is a little more detail on different parts of the tower, and
especially the water feature at the bottom, which currently doesn't exist.

If I have time during my next practice I'd also like to create a few
buildings in the background (with little to no detail) to break up the
horizon line. I'm not aiming for a 1:1 reproduction of the reference image,
there's way too much detail that's not related to the tower itself.
