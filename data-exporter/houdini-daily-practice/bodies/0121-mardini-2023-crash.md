### Mardini 2023 - Crash

Today is day 16 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "crash".

The intention was to create an avalanche, coming down the mountain and "crashing"
into the camera. As it turned out, this was an incredibly ambitious project. I spent
some time researching what avalanches actually look like, noticed that in many videos
the snow behaves a lot like a ton of water, and decided to use a FLIP fluids sim to
model the movement and behavior of the avalanche. I ran several simulations, but none
looked right. Eventually I got one that I thought I could use, although it definitely
didn't behave as I wanted it to.

Even after that, I discovered that I really don't have enough background with particles
or volumetric fog to accurately model the avalanche for the render. I got discouraged
and burned out on the project, considered scrapping everything and coming up with a
different response to the prompt. Eventually I just bit the bullet and started
rendering what I had, even though it's a definite fail. I don't have time to redo
any of this. I have 15 more projects to do before the end of the month and lots of
them are going to take plenty of time as well.

This'll just be another project I look back at and regret. It was worth doing so I
could better learn what I still can't do; maybe in the future I'll figure out
where I went wrong in this whole process.
