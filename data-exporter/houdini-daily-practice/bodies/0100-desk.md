### Cluttered Desk (Day 1)

I'm planning to create a really high-resolution render of two of my projects, then order
a custom two-sided puzzle printed so I can assemble it in a physical form. Just on a whim.
I haven't decided what I'll do for the second side, but the first side will be a variation
on the solar system project I started back in May of last year.

I'm changing it from being an abstract solar-system render to being a desk/office view
with a cluttered desk, including scale models of the planets in the solar system only as
decorations.

Today I added the desk and created a material for it in Adobe Substance Painter.
