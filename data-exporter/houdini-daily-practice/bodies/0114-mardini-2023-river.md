### Mardini 2023 - River

Today is day 9 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "river".

It was a flop. I wanted to simulate a paper boat floating down a street gutter, but
no matter what I try I can't get the Vellum SOP to handle both water _and_ the boat
stand-in softbody mesh. Anything I did to combine them caused the water collisions
to go haywire - not just with the boat, but also with the ground, walls, _other water
particles_, etc. Eventually I realized I was wasting my time for a daily practice
so I baked just the water sim, placed the boat strategically, then rendered a still.

Least favorite Mardini 2023 result so far. Including the tacky-looking rock. I don't
normally feel drained after working in Houdini, this time I do. I didn't even use
TOPs to render this time.

The "S.S. Georgie" texture is created using COPs, but not procedurally. The text
would have to be manually placed again if the UVs were to be updated.

My entry post is [here][entry-post].
