### Mardini 2023 - Leap

Today is day 15 of [Mardini 2023][mardini-2023]. The prompt for today is "leap".

I knocked this one out pretty quickly. I took the prompt less literally, instead
referring to the moon landing over 50 years ago. "One small step for man, one giant
leap for mankind."

I used Vellum cloth to simulate the flag. However, while setting it up, I realized
that although gravity is much reduced on the moon, there is no atmosphere - and
therefore there _is no wind_. Meaning the flag would just droop and not be visible.
However, I did some research and found out that they used a specially-designed
flag pole with a telescoping arm to keep the flag visible. Which I found interesting.

I didn't do much that was new here. Probably the only thing is using an actual
material with textures to render the terrain (which was created with a heightfield.)
But that's not very impressive on the moon, where the landscape is just... rocky
gray dust.

I'm a little concerned about using the US flag in a piece of art, because I'm not
sure what the legality of that is. However, I've seen it done in other contexts
enough that I'm not particularly worried it'll be a problem here, especially using
it respectfully.
