### Procedural House

Today's practice isn't very visibly impressive, but I promise a lot is going on
under the hood. Starting to work on a "house" generator that takes boxes as input
and converts them into randomized houses (just the outside at first.)

It's hollow now, with slightly thick walls. So far it's a whole lot of setup
for a whole lot of nothing. The node tree is an order of magnitude more complex
than anything I've tried before, but that doesn't count for much.

Next steps are to procedurally generate doors, windows, raingutters,
roof railings/crenellations, other decorations.

The idea for now is to generate props, not viable game environments; so the indoors
might have a few visible props through the windows but they won't be
in any way realistic. But this is hightly technical and I definitely didn't have
the necessary background to start on it. Took more than 8 hours today to get
this much (which is depressing.)
