### Heart of the Stone of Tear (Day 3)

The third day of modeling and rendering the Heart of the Stone of Tear; a
significant room in a giant fortress in the Wheel of Time. Now the sword
is placed, and I also swapped out the naked Rand for a pre-rigged demo
asset so that I could position him to reach for the sword. He's
recognizably Rand Al'Thor; you can tell because of the complete lack of
facial features or hair.

I still had to create the materials for Rand though; and that was harder
than expected because although Houdini has a few good tools for setting up
UV maps, it doesn't have any built-in functionality for painting a texture
onto the model itself. Additionally the model I used already had clothing
extruded and part of the model, rather than being a layer on top; so
I had to select parts of the model individually to apply different
materials to the shirt, shoes, pants, and skin.

I _could_ try to find a way to export the model into another program and
paint on a skin texture and facial features; but that's too much work for
one day.

Also today I added arches connecting the pillars at the top to break up
the ceiling of the room. I don't love how it turned out, but I also
don't hate it.
