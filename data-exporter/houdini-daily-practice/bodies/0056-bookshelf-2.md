### Bookshelf (Day 2)

Instead of working on the bookshelf contents, I attempted to more
closely follow the reference image for the walls, floor, and window.
It resulted in a _sorta_ photorealistic look, but mostly it just
looks obviously computer generated.

If I have time I'll add the books/other shelf contents tomorrow, but
I have a few things to do for work still and my PS5 is supposed to
arrive as well. We'll see...
