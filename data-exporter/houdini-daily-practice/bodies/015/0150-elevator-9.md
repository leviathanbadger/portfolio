### 'The Shining' Elevator (Day 9)

Very little changed from the previous practice to today's. I basically just switched
the liquid simulation from the exploding ball that I had as a placeholder to a flood
of blood coming from the elevator. Unfortunately, that was more than enough to make
my personal computer basically unusable for about four days. Just baking the water
sim took 46 hours. Add another day for a baking the blood map and a bunch of other
intermediary caches, and a last day for rendering the scene for 900 frames.

I'm done with this project. Will probably never come back to it. It's too ambitious,
and takes way too long on my personal computer. I'm not completely happy with the
end result, but I'm going to leave it well enough alone.
