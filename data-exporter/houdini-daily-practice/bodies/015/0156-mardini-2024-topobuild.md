### Mardini 2024 - TopoBuild

Today is day 2 of [Mardini 2024][mardini-2024]. The prompt for today is the [TopoBuild SOP
node][topobuild-sop].

This is another node I've never used before, and, frankly, it's a much more useful node
than the Spiral SOP. However, it's also much  more difficult to understand, and - most
distressingly - it's a much more creative node, eschewing procedural modeling for manual,
by-hand fiddling with the model. There is a place for this, and I will definitely be using
the TopoBuild node more in the future to save time, but in many cases using it feels like
a failure of enginuity.

The art itself is... abstract. It's not modeling anything real, it's just throwing random
crap against the wall to see what sticks. Since I was limited for time, I just experimented
with the TopoBuild node and kept working on one that had an interesting visual result, even
though it was aimless and had no real goal.

That said, I learned about/practiced using:

  1. The TopoBuild SOP node, obviously;
  2. Rendering points as spheres, rather than instancing spheres on points, to reduce memory in Karma;
  3. Using a velocity blur to simulate motion in a still frame where I don't actually have other frames
     to use for a distortion-type motion blur.
