### The Sword in the Stone

I spontaneously purchased a 3D printer (a [Bambu X1 Carbon][bambu-x1-carbon])
for fun. The intention was to learn how to design models to optimize the quality
and material use of 3D prints (speed being the next consideration). This is the
first model I created for this purpose.

It's not great. I should have held out for a better material for the rock at least.
The white is pretty ugly; I may have to come back to this at some point and either
reprint it, or figure out how to paint it to look better.

I also spent some time creating a 3D render with the same model, although here I
cheated and added a bunch more detail that wouldn't have been possible with a 3D
print.
