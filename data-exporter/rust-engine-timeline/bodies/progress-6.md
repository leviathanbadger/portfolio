### OBJ Loading

Following along with the Rust-Vulkan tutorial to be able to load OBJ models for rendering.
I had to fix an issue with their code, although it's probably not their fault for the tutorial
being wrong. The OBJ loading library changed default behaviors since the tutorial was written,
and the sample model only works coincidentally.

The model used here is one I created for one of my Houdini daily practices. You can find it
[here][die-model].
