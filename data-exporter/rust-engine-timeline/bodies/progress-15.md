### Specular lighting

I just threw in support for specular lighting to slightly improve the output image.
The screenshot here looks dim still mostly because I'm still looking at it on an HDR
screen, and the tonemap postprocessing steps aren't exactly equivalent for HDR and
SDR. Imagine you're looking at it in a dim room.
