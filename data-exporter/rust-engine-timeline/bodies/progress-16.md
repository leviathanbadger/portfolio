### Tangents & Normal Map

Although I've heard of normal mapping before, and I've used it in various other engines, this is
my first time implementing it in my own engine. The result isn't exactly what I wanted - it works
well enough, but does have visible artifacting on UV seams, which should not be occurring.
Even so, I think overall the result is acceptable for now. Mostly because I want to move onto
bigger and better things, and don't want to get bogged down on this.
