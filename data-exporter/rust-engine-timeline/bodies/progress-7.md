### Surface Normals and Diffuse Lighting

Here I added ambient light and a single directional light used to compute diffuse lighting for
models using the Blinn lighting model (not even Blinn-Phong, let alone some kind of
physically-based render model.)

There were also a few refactors and under-the-hood features that, again, don't have a visual
representation.

The model used here is one I created for one of my Houdini daily practices. You can find it
[here][die-model].
