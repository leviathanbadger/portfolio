  ### Spinning Cube

  This is just a natural progression from the previous screenshot. All that's changed
  is that the ModelView matrix is getting updated from frame to frame. The rotation is
  done in a time-accurate way using the frame's delta time, but this isn't really that
  big a deal. All of the work to accomplish it was already done for the previous
  screenshot.
