### What is DocSource?

[DocSource.io][docsource] is a documentation tool build for developer teams.
It integrates with GitHub so that when you log in, all of your Git repositories are in one place
and you can easily host documentation for your public and private repositories.

You can also create organizations and invite others to join those organizations, allowing
teams to quickly build documentation and take notes in a clean, structured tree format.
Pages are created and edited easily using standard markdown syntax,
and consumed even more easily with a powerful documentation search.

The site also sports a handy sidebar automatically populated with every repository you
own or have contributed to on GitHub. You can also manually add projects to the sidebar.
Developers can easily jump between documentation for their projects and organizations,
or they can open a repository on GitHub with a single click.
