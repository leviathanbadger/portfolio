### Cellular Automata

One of the first concepts that initially helped me get into programming
when I was younger was the idea of "Cellular Automata." (Singular "Cellular Automaton.")
They still fascinate me today.

A cellular automaton is a simulation based around a grid of cells.
Each cell interacts with the cells around it in some predetermined way, modifying their state.
Usually the rules are very simple, but depending on the rules and initial configuration,
then end result can be spectacular.

You may not have heard of them before, but you have almost certainly seen them.
Historically, one of the most popular instances of a cellular automaton was and is
"Conway's Game of Life." A more modern example is "Minecraft," although Minecraft isn't
a pure example of a cellular automaton because not everything in it is
perfectly aligned to a grid.

For a small school project, I decided to create a procedural continent generator using some
concepts of cellular automata. Using a very simple algorithm, I can create highly realistic
landmasses that could eventually be used in a game or a digitally created artform.
