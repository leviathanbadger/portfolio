### AI Playground

This playground was created using my HTML5 game engine.
It was built using an early iteration, so there were no physics, and I had to
build out many new features into the engine to get it to work.

The primary purpose of the exercise was to experiment with building various types of
artificial intelligences. I experimented with flocking algorithms, A* pathfinding,
artificial fog of war, finite state machines, and various other, smaller behavioral algorithms.
The end result is not a game, but it is still entertaining to watch the various spawned
creatures navigate the game world.

In the demo, the controls are labeled in the top-left corner of the screen.
