### Angular Vector Editor

This project was created for a school project in about a week.
It's a frontend app that uses Angular to create a simple vector graphic editor.
You can create as many artboards as you want; they are persisted in localStorage
so that they are accessible on the same computer between runs.

This project was a challenge for me partially because I had never before used Angular
to create namespaced elements. It was fun to learn how to create inline SVGs
in this way. It was also a good learning experience to figure out how to make
the abstraction of an artboard fit the MVC style of programming that is intrinsic
to Angular development.

In addition, I had the experience of importing and using two custom Angular components
that I'd never used before: a drag and drop list ordering component,
and a color picker that is non-blocking and slightly more fancy than the browsers' default.
