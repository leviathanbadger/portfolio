### Portfolio Project

This project was created to be my digital portfolio.
It solves the problem of helping me demonstrate my extensive programming experience
when I'm not physically present to make the defence myself.

As a digital portfolio for a web developer, it wouldn't be of much use if I just used
a preexisting template or built it using a content-first crutch website builder.
In that spirit, this project was created from scratch using modern web technologies
such as Angular 2+, Typescript, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Webpack, and SASS.

I had a lot of fun creating many custom components and learning how to use
Angular's animations module. If you'd like to see how I created anything on the site,
you can refer back to this project for a link to the source code. Just click the big
blue button above.
