### Boulder Physics Game

This game was created as my final project in a game physics class.
It uses the custom HTML5 engine that I spent several months building,
including the physics engine that I added in the month before
starting this project.

You start at the top of a mountain during an earthquake.
The point of the game is to follow the mountain slope down to the base
without being crushed by the boulders that are knocked loose from further
up the mountain slope.

For the easy levels, it may be a valid strategy to just run down
as quickly as possible; but on the harder levels the player is required
to allow boulders to collect in small pockets so that the player can
jump on them and use them like ladders to climb over sheer cliffs that
prevent the player's advancement.

The game features ten prebuilt levels, along with a random level generator
that allows you to play new levels, ranging from moderately difficult
to insanely challenging.
